R Deu,There are  separate areas with arm chairs and TV for relaxing and working the other with other arm chairs PC computer TV bar and sitting area. There are newspapers and magazines also some airline magazines. Decoration is fresh and modern. It is clean and well maintained. Bottled drinks coffee machine cheese and salad sandwiches and sweets. This is a very small airport serving about  flights a day and the lounge is fine and over the quality of other airlines I visited in the past. If they provide a better coffee machine and a wider choice of snacks it would be quite an interesting lounge to relax.,3,-0.232618709
Andreas Kar,"It is a small, dark, windowless lounge located on the rd floor, accessible via elevator. The bar is well equipped with soft drinks, coffee, wines and biers.",5,1.333657488
A Diakomichalis,Both of the lounges have the same food (sandwiches yogurt cheese cheese pie fruits) and beverages (all sorts of coffee tea  bottled drinks alcoholic drinks  Greek wine) .The decoration in Thessaloniki is very stylish and the bathroom too . Athens is nice but probably needs to be updated.,5,1.333657488
R Deu,The lounge was clean and the decor is up to date with colourful chairs. Only one PC and mainly empty bar. Food is some sandwiches cheese and nuts. A lot needs to be improved. I went to Lufthansa lounge where hot food was provided.,2,-1.015756808
Petros Papadopoulos,Big and spacious lounge. Comfy sofas and a nice variety of food/drinks. The lounge was recently refurbished and looks very stylish. stuff very friendly and they let you know when your flight starts boarding.,5,1.333657488
D Bissett,Surprisingly pleasant lounge. If traveling through Greece Thessaloniki makes a much better transfer point than Athens and this lounge was quite comfy and pleasant. The shuttle from the lounge to our flight is nice. Aegean Airlines was a pleasant host on our trip to Greece.,4,0.550519389
Christos Louis,"Large well lit lounge with a separate smoking area. It can be crowded at times but it is still relatively quiet unless somebody starts screaming into hes/her cell phone. Sandwiches ice cream cheese peanuts and croissants are always there and the bar is so so (no champagne!) with good espresso. Three computers are available and lately free Wi-fi is also provided. Relatively comfortable ""wire"" seats are available at round tables but if one sits at one of the sofas the risk of falling asleep is high. Careful lots of walking to some gates (especially B and ) and sometimes lengthy security screen is after the lounge. Overall though a good lounge.",4,0.550519389
S Nichols,Nice spacious area. Wifi is fine. Quiet. Self-serve food and bar area but limited offering for food. For breakfast - cereals and Danish. Staffing need some schooling on customer service a smile goes a long way but no-one was cracking even a small grin. No direction on the layout.,3,-0.232618709
U Wright,Paid Â£ for Are Lingus Lounge use for myself and my daughter on way to New York from Belfast via Dublin Airport. Couldn't believe such poor food offer at breakfast time.  cereals in plastic dispensers and a shared bowl of fruit salad to cater for everyone. Some small croissants only and not nice taste at that. Nothing else. Also poor reception from staff. What a rip off.,3,-0.232618709
Alan Wan,Much nicer lounge than the old terminal . There was lots of light from the floor to ceiling windows and good views of the runaway. However the choice of food (we were there -.am) was very limited: cereals croissants cheese and crackers. No bread or porridge. However the coffee was decent and if you really fancied it there was a good choice of alcohol.,4,0.550519389
D Boyne,On return to UK visited Aer Lingus lounge. Clean and pleasant enough. Limited facilities and far from gates buried somewhere in terminal . At euros per person it is very poor value.,3,-0.232618709
Sean Leonard,Regularly used this lounge in the past year always found it good used it Saturday th October and what a change for the worse no longer provide sandwiches (told they can't find a supplier by one of the staff) so lukewarm soup and brown bread all that was available. No small bottles of sparking water only big bottles that had been opened all day gone flat. A woman told me in bad English that they have stopped the bottles of sparkling water as the airline loses revenue on onboard sales. Felt the whole experience was a let down. Aer Lingus you've done better in the past this is terrible.,2,-1.015756808
Steve Patten,"Surly and unfriendly receptionists . On my Aer Lingus prestige my wife and I were permitted entry but told my two young children would not be allowed in. Never experienced that in a Gold Circle. So we sat outside and went in to get refreshments. They then watched us and it felt like we were being ""watched"" the entire time. Not even a great lounge. Very budget.",1,-1.798894906
F Hogan,"The Oasis lounge seems to be shared amongst all the users of T at JFK. I didn't see any other lounges. Because of that lack of competition it seems that the staff are just not bothered. The ""welcome"" is perfunctory at best and at worst is really an entitlement check after whether the staff lose interest in the passenger. Signage is poor no times/distances to various gates no advertising other facilities to passengers. Trying to plug in an iPhone charger was tricky as the first  sockets I found were both broken exposing the innards of the socket wiring. Seating in the quiet area was not very comfortable. All in all I wouldn't be rushing back.",3,-0.232618709
A O'Connell,Showers toilets decent range of snacks and drinks together with newspapers and mags. It is bright and airy and has a quite zone.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,Bright and spacious lounge. Drink and food selection reasonable but not brilliant. It is on two levels I would choose the upper level as the views are better but food choice slightly better downstairs.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,I used this lounge for a .am departure. It was not very busy but was claustrophobic. The staff were welcoming and seemed happy to play with a passenger's toddler. The seating could do with a good clean. Food limited - cereal cheap cheese and biscuits and even cheaper croissants. As a Gold Circle member I had free entry - but if you have to pay don't bother.,3,-0.232618709
Patrick Jordan,The new lounge spans two floors with views of the apron A water feaTUre dominates one wall. There are work stations and complimentary wifi. The range of food on offer during the early morning is sufficient and a bar service is available. This lounge has own showers and washrooms something the former lounge lacked. The lounge is also open to non FFP members for a euro fee.,4,0.550519389
M Berman,Sitting here now kicking myself that I bought a day pass. Absolutely the most dismal depressing miserable lounge. In a windowless bunker. Shoddy uncomfortable furniture inedible old sandwiches indifferent attendant. I guess the troubles in Ireland filter down to their Airport lounges.,2,-1.015756808
N Holohan,Ample seating including armchairs and full-length recliners. Complimentary WiFi and a number of booths to work on your laptop along with three or four PCs (with very old software!). Staff helpful and courteous. Bar has a selection of hot and cold drinks including soft drinks and alcohol. A limited selection of hot food. Large selection of newspapers.,5,1.333657488
D Berry,Not to the same standard as other lounges (eg. Amsterdam) but actually pretty good. Staff (when they're there) are nice and the lounge has a nice little selection of food and drink and free internet (although fair play to cork it's free throughout the airport). My only issue with cork is that it doesn't open until i think something like : although the flight to amsterdam leaves at :. As with their other lounges no toilets although this doesn't really bother me that much.,3,-0.232618709
J Russell,I'm sitting in the lounge a bit incredulous that I paid for access to this. I paid for it because I had a lot of time to kill and it seemed a good way to pass the day. What a gloomy awful lounge. I found this page because I was looking to see if maybe I'd missed something because it seems there is no free WiFi. Completely insane. I thought this was for business travellers? The girl at the desk looked me up and down when I walked in too so apparently despite having a lounge that looks like a rd grade classroom without the fun stuff on the walls (or windows) they have a problem with how people dress? I'm neatly attired but I'm flying today so I am absolutely not wearing a suit. Anyway the long and short of it is that the lounge is unfriendly no amenities no toilets no natural light can't really see myself bothering with it again.,1,-1.798894906
Patrick Jordan,My first visit to the Gold Circle lounge in many months. I was aware from other reviews of the decrease in size but I didn't expect to see the work stations gone too. The only saving grace is that there is a choice of breads and pastries in the morning.,2,-1.015756808
Patrick Jordan,The range of food and beverages is reasonable. The main attraction of this lounge is that it is beside boarding gates. This evening I noticed the red wine bottle was empty. I asked the attendant to replace it but she wasn't able to open the new bottle. I can understand a bottle of wine being used but to have a staff member unable to open another is beyond belief. What used to be a very good lounge has become almost a joke.,2,-1.015756808
Shane Martin,The Gold Circle Lounge at EI home airport of Dublin has just been cut in size by around two thirds. Only a corner of the old lounge remains and the rest has been transformed into a staff room. Rather typical of EI really - an airline that typically seems to put staff ahead of customers. What remains of the lounge is mostly hard airport style seating. Not very must when we visited. Limited selection of drinks. Nice cookies. Glasses were very old and a little too dirty to use. Not convenient to most of EI's departure gates ( min walk and then backtrack +  more minutes).,1,-1.798894906
Dave Houlihan,I have posted previous comments on Aer Lingus lounges but nothing prepared me for the filthy tip that is Chicago Gold Circle lounge. Its tiny dirty furniture all stained ceiling was all stained. Drinks okay no food not even a cracker. I don't normally fly biz class with EI and judging by the reviews and the state of the lounges I never will.,2,-1.015756808
Mark Ackery,I got to use the Aer Lingus lounge as I was flying on Icelandair. This has got to be the pokiest grubbiest lounge I have ever seen or used. The food was soggy and not fresh and the decor is not very good. Gives a feeling of boredom and gloom. Aer Lingus needs to brighten this lounge up a lot. The lady there was nice and friendly - she was the best part about this lounge.,2,-1.015756808
G Reynolds,This lounge has so much potential - it's bright clean and offers sweeping views of the airfield. However the desk staff can range from super-friendly (letting me bring my kids in sometimes) to totally indifferent (too busy gossiping with colleagues to say hello). There is a good range of drinks on offer but food is poor and is restricted to bags of twiglets (does anyone actually like them??!) and crackers with DUTCH cheese (so much for strong Irish brand identity which Aer Lingus supposedly prides itself on). Plus there is a charge for internet usage which is a shame.,2,-1.015756808
S Halford,Very basic but better than filthy overcrowded terminal. Food choice limited to biscuits and packaged cheddar cheese. Good selection of drinks - alcoholic and non. Staff friendly to indifferent depending on when you visit. Washrooms outside lounge - shared with other lounges and filthy.,2,-1.015756808
S Halford,Excellent lounge with good selection of food drink and newspapers. Wifi access etc. I suspect that the high standards are not down to Aer Lingus as the lounge is shared with a number of major international airlines. I say this because the Aer Lingus exclusive lounges at Dublin (home base) and London Heathrow are extremely poor by comparison. Their lounges at Chicago O'Hare and Boston are amongst the worse I have ever encountered.,5,1.333657488
David Andrews,"Everyone agrees that this lounge beats sitting in the awful ""tube"" outside but that's about it. Aer Lingus you need to incorporate free WiFi some food e.g sandwiches or whatever and get some toilets in there. This is as another user points out barely worth the trouble of keeping up Gold Circle Membership for.",1,-1.798894906
C Wajsberg,"Air France lounge spacious without being nice, just practical. Breakfast consisted of croissants and some other food. On the Asian side different filled pastries and instant noodles. Plenty of fresh fruit also available. Alcohol and wine bar fully stocked already, even if it was  am and serve yourself as much as you want. Fine relaxing lounge with all you can wish for.",6,2.116795586
H Dalem,"The Galaxy Lounge at the E-Terminal looks a bit dated. It is a large and very open space. Enough different seating arrangements. A separate space for computers. And a food and drinks counter. Due to the open space one can hear almost every conversation. To make things worse they play loud music. Food is ok. Enough choice but not much of a display. Drinks are also ok. Enough choice. Alcohol you have to ask (except beer). WiFi speed is great and free. Shower room is a strange affair. You get a 'space towel' and some slippers. If you don't bring your own shampoo and/or soap, you are left with only water to wash yourself. The towel is a big paper cloth you can dispose of after the shower. Slippers have the same design. You don't enter this space for a spa treatment, but it does refresh. If you have to sit here for a long time this will not be a relaxing experience.",6,2.116795586
C Wajsberg,Small lounge with not enough comfortable chairs. No english or international reading material. Wifi works well. Food of very poor quality and boring. Was surely not impressed by this lounge but have visited worse in my life.,3,-0.232618709
Anders Pedersen,Aeroflot Galaxy Galaktica Sirius Classic Jazz and Blues Lounges in SVO. Access while travelling on business require invitation card from transfer desk but happened smoothly. In SVO you are semi-free to choose which of - Aeroflot lounges you want access to. I prefer the newest Galaktica (=Galaxy) in terminal E Classic in terminal F and Blues in terminal D. Other lounges like Sirius in E and Jazz in D (a parallel or copy of Blues) must wait for another time (Sirius is a special lounge at terminal E - only for disabled â€“ it is virtually a requirement for entering!). Drinks plenty â€“ up to medium quality. Lounge hopping not always possible - even by use of SKY-gold card. Lounges prefer you stay at the lounges at departing gate but it depends on staff. Galaktika is the best of all of those I know big and smart design and colourful orange furniture with good business and smoking sections â€“ further it has views to and outside airport. Other lounges do not have views. Views are much better from the commercial areas outside the lounges. Food is bread oriented but heating of croissants sandwiches bread rolls are possible. Some lounges (at least Classic) sells quality hot food at an additional price like a restaurant within the lobby. Showers fine but scarce.,3,-0.232618709
B Li,The reception turned me back to a transit desk for lounge invitation. Then I was turned again to a transit lounge nearby where I finally got the invitation printed out. Due to transit I was entitled to a lounge in terminal F (Sheremyetevo Classic) but remembering its poor dungeon-like conditions I sneaked into the Galactica - offering more space and windows. Food - only cold snacks (potato chips crackers peanuts bread with cheese bread with some sausage etc). Drinks - range of soft drinks and alcohol. Free WiFi. Lounge quite clean toilets inside shower room and smoking room under construction. On the way to the gate entered Sheremyetevo Classic lounge to find it has been refurbished - larger (but still much smaller than Galactica) completely renovated. Food the same in both lounges but I've noticed champagne available in the Classic. A smoking room inside available.,3,-0.232618709
B Li,Aeroflot used CX's The Wing lounge before so I was worried a bit about the new one. The Traveller's is not as airy and spacy as The Wing however well equipped and nice too. Many warm options for breakfast and free access to the alcohol bar. Just  showers (so you have to wait for your turn) maintained well and clean. Overall okay experience with good food and drinks.,4,0.550519389
S Khan,A throwback to the old Soviet era - except that they have  PCs with Internet access. The food is pretty bad: couple of bread rolls - but where is the margarine? Newspapers and magazines are all Russian - yet this lounge is for all Skyteam airlines. Bathrooms aren't clean. Sofas are pretty comfortable but there's no window view. A couple of television sets that are running the same damn Russian TV channel.,2,-1.015756808
Mike Franklin,Oh dear nothing changes here! Not allowed into the lounge until  hours before flight despite having a  hour layover. Once in the lounge you wonder what the wait was for. No natural light lounge arrange in  areas all rather dark and at peak times impossible to find a seat. The food is poor to say the least and staff at beverage counter seem reluctant to offer drinks! There are some PCs at one end but very variable connection and not very useful. Small toilet area no showers - all in all a disgrace for a SkyTeam member airline.,2,-1.015756808
Tammu Karte,It took a long walk and searching to arrive at the Premier International lounge after mistakenly entering the Domestic one in Terminal . There seems to be a shortage of cool air in the public areas of the terminal and the Business Lounge did not provide a relief at that point. Air seems to be in short supply here and was replenished every twenty minutes which seemed to be a long time when the indoor temperature reached F. The lounge is spacious with food offering that included: stale sandwiches good mini cheese cakes a good variety of packaged sweet and salty snacks cold drinks and unrefrigerated â€œicedâ€ tea. Computers for usage was complimentary.,3,-0.232618709
G Smith,I am writing this review as I sit in the lounge. Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now. In general lots of empties left around to point some travellers are clearing up instead. Wifi works well at least.,2,-1.015756808
Juan Fernando,Very nice used it late in the night so not too many people. Nice selection of liquors and spirits. No food (only snacks as pastries some fruit granola peanuts and crackers) as their policy is to serve food only during Mexican meal times (- am - pm -pm). They have a wine club (paying customers) with excellent sandwiches. Nice selection of local newspapers but they should add some international newspapers and magazines. They have showers toilets video games section for kids internet area free wifi. Staff friendly and professional.,4,0.550519389
R Scot,Fairly basic lounge. Nice enough but a little crowded. Good selection of self serve alcohol and soft drinks. No real food beyond peanuts and stuff. Decent wireless and - internet terminals. Overall pretty nice for Tijuana.,3,-0.232618709
Ray Miles,Mexico City's new terminal  was barely up and running when I flew out on a Copa Airlines flight that gave me access to the Aeromexico lounge. The lounge is upstairs and is light elegant and airy albeit with no windows onto the tarmac. Comfy seating a separate computer area wifi throughout and attractive palm trees add a festive air. There is a circular bar that was unmanned during my visit plus a smaller self-service bar with an excellent selection of drinks and classy snacks. There is a separate screened-off TV lounge and another wine bar at the back for paying customers only. Since the lounge was brand-new it was obvious an effort was being made to impress. It will be important to monitor progress as time passes to see if the high standard in maintained.,4,0.550519389
J Williams,I wouldn't really call it a business class lounge. Its basically just seats in a bar that are reserved for Business Class passengers. There are no free refreshments and although there are a wide range of drinks and snacks available they are all quite expensive.,2,-1.015756808
Bertrand Chauffier,Somewhat small this is the single airport lounge at Almaty Airport what I believe services all airlines. Seating areas ok small bar and food counter to one side. I could not get my laptop to access any wifi. There was a computer station with internet access at one end of the room but the airport staff seemed to be using this when I visited! A small bathroom area  Tv's but not much else.,3,-0.232618709
Stefan Baldauf,"The lounge in Vienna that is open for Flyniki and Air Berlin flights is quite good. Nice range of breakfast stuff. (cheese, ham, marmelade), nice coffee range, some cereals, fresh fruit. The staff in the lounge is friendly and attentive.",6,2.116795586
Daniel Houser,Surprised at complete lack of lounge when flying Air Berlin out of Berlin. Because of the need to get transfer passport control and security check at gate you really have no option and then you're in a space too small for the number of people bad wifi inadequate lighting dirty and  food vendor as the only amenity. This business class lounge experience was quite surprising. Once I was on-board the experience was great but the departure experience will keep me from connecting through Berlin again.,1,-1.798894906
G Chandler,"Travellers are warned that the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary Intl Airport is undergoing construction. Based on our visit, this is an understatement. We visited the lounge in mid-July  to be greeted by an experience of very poor seating, meagre food offerings and overcrowding. Even restrooms were only limitedly available, due to cleaning which went on for quite some time. In some cases, an airport may offer venues so peaceful and reasonable that it pays to visit them instead of using the airline lounge. The Maple Leaf Lounge at Calgary international exemplifies a second situation where the lounge is so inadequate and overcrowded that even poor airport venues make for a better place to wait for flights. Lounge personnel here were more interested in surfing the Internet than assisting airline customers with questions about connections or required services.",2,-1.015756808
Erez Hartal,"A nice lounge, with nice view of the tarmac.  soups on choice, Dips, as well as salads and sandwiches. Self serve soft drinks and alcohol. Have a kid zone, business center. I can see it can be crowded. Only accessible via elevators. No stairs. So take extra time before leaving the lounge to get to your gate. Better than any Delta, American, United lounges. Still weaker than average premium lounge in Europe.",6,2.116795586
Abbey Klugerman,The terminal is under renovation and as a result it was difficult to find the entrance to the Air Canada business class lounge. The seating in the lounge was okay (we spent a couple of hours there) but the food and the Air Canada staff were poor at best.,6,2.116795586
Stephen Lloyd,Having flow out of T twice on Eva Air recently this review covers both visits. Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (- minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space. Travelling on a Wednesday evening there were not many people in the lounge and it felt quite and comfortable. A vast improvement on the old T lounge shared with SAS.,4,0.550519389
M Trebuch,Worst lounge we have ever seen. Food buffet was almost empty and dirty and not filled up within hours. Washrooms very dirty. Noisy. Disappointing experience.,1,-1.798894906
P Rubenstein,"Air Canada has made significant improvements in most of its lounges and they are obvious with the upgrade in service and food selection being noticeable. Gone are the days of dirty dishes and rude staff. It has been a welcome improvement. Unfortunately the YYZ MLL International lounge at the E gates seems to have been left behind. On the day I used it it was very busy with limited food offered and an unpleasant ambience. There are just too many people using the lounge many of whom have access because of their frequent flyer status. The end result is that pax who are flying on the expensive long haul flights in business class receive a mediocre experience. It's time for AC to divide the lounge into two sections one for the true international business class and ""Super Elite"" status pax and the other for the basic ""Elite"" pax and those flying on shorter route Rouge Premium. Provide a quiet area with better food for the first group and keep the current set up for the second group. My biggest wish is for AC to provide decent wifi access in its Canadian lounges. I have had better wifi access in ""developing"" world airports.",2,-1.015756808
John Doran,Now seated in lounge after a two week trip with time spent in other business class lounges Think Toronto maple leaf lounge is one of the worst we have visited Have visited this lounge often but prompted to finally share my thoughts with other travellers as the offering of a few salad items chilli Con carne and stale bread receives a failing grade Air Canada's food is consistently weaker than other competitors.,2,-1.015756808
M Smyth,Very comfortable and nicely decorated lounge with small but high quality food and drinks selection. Plenty of seating space and some proper tables and chairs to dine at rather than just sofas everywhere. Nice place.,5,1.333657488
Barbara Wiltshire,This is the worst lounge. Bathrooms dirty and over flowing trash minimal lounge areas and NO BAR. They don't have a liquor license. All this at a time when the terminal at LAX is under renovation and offers minimal services. I can't believe a first class lounge could be so bad.,1,-1.798894906
Chilun Li,I visit this Lounge six times a year in the pass few years. In my every visit the feelings are more or less the same in average except the food choices is very disappointing only cup cakes vegetables and cold boiled eggs. I have never encounter of any hot food nor hot soup in this lounge. Asian instant noodle is never seen here. My wife even prefer to sit outside in those paid cafe to have proper eating.,3,-0.232618709

D Carter,"I am always pretty pleased with the Air Canada Lounges (Vancouver is very good and so is Edmonton). Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a  minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry. Staff still very courteous.",4,0.550519389
W Atkinson,After a very long walk from check in through security and then into TB (this is the terminal adjacent to the new Terminal  at Heathrow where Air Canada has its arrival/departure operations) we finally arrived at the Lounge,,
W Atkinson,vMy spouse and I were flying to LHR via YUL on Premium Economy fares so we were able to purchase Maple Leaf (ML) access for the day of our travel. This is a relatively new Lounge in Winnipeg's James Richardson International Airport which opened a new terminal in . The Lounge is easy to find near Gate . Staff were not particularly friendly and just verified our boarding passes without comment. We got seating window-side and helped ourselves to beverages and breakfast prior to our flight to YUL. All amenities and services were very good and seating is plentiful and comfortable.,4,0.550519389
W Atkinson,After a long and frustrating process getting through customs and security after our flight from LHR we were looking forward to accessing the domestic terminal ML Lounge before our next two flights home. As usual it was a challenge finding the Lounge and the few Air Canada employees we talked to just grunted and pointed to another annex of the domestic terminal to its location - still not clear. We walked a considerable distance from our departure gate to somewhere near Gate  to access the Lounge. We were greeted by the same indifference from Lounge staff we experienced in our previous three ML Lounge visits in our trip to the UK,,
W Atkinson,After a very long walk from Gate  to Gate  we finally found the Maple Leaf Lounge in the International area of the YUL terminal. We found way finding signage in YUL to be barely adequate and that is being generous. This also held true for finding this Lounge. Staff were polite but not overly friendly,,
Paul Nesbitt,EVA use the Air Canada Lounge in the new Terminal . A very nice airy new lounge at the new Terminal. It was very quiet when I was there ,,
David Gallant,We visited the Air Canada transborder Lounge on the th of Sept. We were very pleased with the service and facilities offered. We had a long lay over and enjoyed both the breakfast and lunch offered. A variety of beverages were available. The lounge was very clean and roomy.,5,1.333657488
J Taylor,BRU-YUL-SFO. We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a -hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about  ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King. Other than that however the internet is fast and functional there is a television and a wide selection of alcoholic beverages in an open-bar format. Not the best lounge but certainly not the worst.,4,0.550519389

C Moreira,The lounge of transhipment for flights to the United States. provides appropriate care. The Buffett is very good tasty including wide range of drinks. Wi Fi works and is fast. There are several workstation. The furniture is beautiful. In the room you stay comfortable all the time. A proper and respectful service with passengers. If you option Air Canada deserves to be prestigious.,4,0.550519389
R Arzah,The Maple Leaf Lounge in the International Section of Terminal  at Toronto's Pearson Airport is a pleasant lounge with lots of seating. The lounge has a good selection of drinks but the food selection is much less than what one gets in Europe or Asia. I was in the lounge in the evening (after :pm) and they had noodles and a cold salad. They may have had soup as well. Cookies were available. The beverage supply is large and self serve. There are three Air Canada (Maple Leaf) Lounges at Toronto's Pearson Airport Terminal  one domestic one International and one for flights to the U.S. This review is for the international lounge which is used for Air Canada and Star Alliance members. In terms of layout and aesthetics this is a very pleasant lounge. It has a business area lots of seating showers and eating areas with big screen tvs. The newspaper and magazibne supply is huge The airport has free wifi,,
N Erskine,"Have visited this lounge in the ""rock wall"" in the domestic area several times over the past few years this visit in March  I noticed that the food selection had improved. I was there at am on a Friday morning for . hrs and aside from the usual cold cereal hot oatmeal make your own toast small muffins/pastries and fruit there was a covered hot container with small omelets hash browns and large home fries. The coffee machines are wonderful offering mochas  lattes cappuccinos etc. Also hot chocolate. The serving dishes were kept filled and there was someone going around picking up used plates/cups etc frequently. The lounge seemed very clean as well as the women's washroom. The lounge is large and was about /-/ full all the time I was there. Good selection of newspapers and lots of different magazines. Wifi seemed to work fine the little I used it. Great view of the continuous action out on the tarmac!",5,1.333657488
Sang Fung,I have a Priority Pass and on my way from CPT to BOS via LHR I had about  hours to kill. I thought I would use the lounge airside but after a  hour flight I wanted a shower and a light breakfast. This Air Canada Arrivals was heaven sent. It is just outside the arrivals hall to the left. Please watch out for signs because it is quite tricky to find. Once you are there the small but cosy lounge welcomes you with open arms. Good hot and cold food plus good coffee or tea a shower (very refreshing) and comfortable seats. Small if the place is crowded but at am it was very quiet.,5,1.333657488
Ian Cromack,My first experience of YYZ's T Domestic lounge got off to a bad start as the agent at the desk was engaged in a scintillating conversation with another agent regarding the closest gas stations to their homes. She never made eye contact offered any sort of welcome and simply handed back my boarding pass without so much as a thank you. Thanks Air Canada for making me feel like a valued customer! The lounge itself is attractive well groomed has ample seating and moderately appealing food choices. A far cry from the catering one would find in Star Alliance lounges in Europe or Asia but not bad by North American (United for example) standards.,3,-0.232618709
Keith Rogers,Wow a bad terminal in a horrible airport with a terrible lounge. Small poor food poor seating tiny and overall as far as international lounges a real disappointment. The Starbucks on main level is much better.,2,-1.015756808
V Nagaraj,The quality of internet access that the lounge offers is a joke. They expect Star Alliance Gold customers to pay $. to use the internet because the free service they offer cannot even open basic websites. What's more embarrassing is that the free service offered by Vancouver airport is much faster and doesn't cripple your access to web services. Other Star Alliance members should return the favour for Air Canada visitors to their lounges. In a world where bandwidth has become as cheap as water it is ridiculous that Air Canada can get away with fleecing other Star Alliance customers.,3,-0.232618709
J Patterson,Lounge in Beijing which we used twice (London to Sydney return) was fine but did not have enough toilets and showers.,3,-0.232618709
Ralf Friedrichsen,Arriving in Toronto at about .pm we had a very long layover since the departure to CPH was at .. The lounge was ok but the food choices and quality were very disappointing. Sort of dry boring sandwiches and three different warm dishes - all tasteless. If we should have waiting time at Toronto airport another day we rather pay for food in one of the eating places in the terminal than eating in the lounge. For a business class lounge of a  star airline the food is not adequate and compared to Scandinavian Airlines lounge in Copenhagen and Chicago it's poor. Even the TAP lounge at Lisbon airport has better food quality.,3,-0.232618709
R Auld,Nice lounge quiet and good internet  but needs to have dirty dishes picked up more often. Also their food offerings are poor. empty wine bottles and no staff to ask for assistance. Chips and hummus you need to scrape the bowl for. They need more staff and replace items more often. I still recommend it but if you need food go get it somewhere else first.,3,-0.232618709
M Swaiton,We used this on our inbound flight from New York and clearly we arrived at peak time. Not a seat to be found and the lounge was generally dirty and poorly managed. Staff on front-desk were more like guards than customer service staff. They scowled did not look up to greet us and were a very poor impression of Chinese service - in fact they were just rude. Food (as commented here already) was like a poor quality works canteen and mushy food that was not even hot. I looked at shower after a  minute wait and decided against using it. How does Star Alliance allow Air China to stay in with such low standard facilities? Never again on Air China.,2,-1.015756808
P Bingham,At peak times the lounge gets very crowded and on hot sunny days you should avoid this lounge - it is stifling and the aircon never works properly. Staff on reception can be very friendly or very rude and inattentive - there does not seem to be an area in the middle. You can no longer get a fresh coffee and they removed the coffee machine that was installed for a few months and this is first class! The food is canteen type and rather greasy chinese food and probably best to wait for your flight to get a bite to eat. The toilets are kept clean by attendant that waits for you to tip him when you go in! The shower is tiny smells of drains and is best avoided. Furniture is tired and quite grubby and generally feel this lounge has continued to get worse and worse in the last  years. Avoid and go downstairs to Pizza Hut or Costa/Starbucks coffee for a nicer experience.,2,-1.015756808
M Solo,The lounge was physically fine but the snacks/food offerings were pathetic. A few applies and bananas sliced white bread for toast and pitchers of juice. I ended up with cereal and milk and thinking that there was great food for people flying coach right outside the doors. Also even with a sparsely populated lounge there was a line for the mens room because the mens room must apparently only cater to one person at a time.,2,-1.015756808
R Menes,I was surprised by the selection of quality food and alcoholic beverages. Being US-based I was able to compare the many differences between the US airline lounges with the quality of Air Canada. Maple Leaf Lounges are definitely the benchmark for other North American Airlines.,5,1.333657488
Harry Aronowicz,"I used the lounge on nd December  at around AM. The staff at the welcome desk worked very hard to solve a very tricky problem. Their knowledge and level of care was absolutely great. They solved a problem which could have ruined our long planned holiday. I was very impressed and thankful. If there would be a possibility to rate the level of ""Standard of Staff Service"" better then Excellent - I would do so. The Transborder Maple Leaf Lounge at Terminal  Toronto Airport was exceptional due to the superior staff.",3,-0.232618709
Jeremy Lawrance,The lounge is spacious with leather seats in groups of two. There are some dining tables in the area of the food. The food was mixed Chinese with a choice of dumplings noodles and stir fries. Sandwiches and other packaged snacks are plentiful. Beer and wine is available but wine selection is limited. There are several sleeping pods available together with small shower facility.,4,0.550519389
R Salzer,"My wife and I visited the Air China First Class Lounge at PEK on October . We were flying United Global First to Washington DC IAD. We had  hours to departure at :PM. When we entered the Lounge we found it to be very warm actually hot. It is a very large lounge and there were very few people there at the time. There were about  people working the front desk but I never saw any Air China Agents working in the lounge. The seting was leather chairs fairly comfortable with a small table between seating for . There was hot food available but it didn't appeal to Western tast mostly rice and soup We passed on the food. Some snacks the kind you scoop out of a jar with a spoon. The guy who was there before us had his hand in all the jars without the spoon so we passed on them also. Next we tried the bar. Self service with very little selection. I only saw Chinese beer in the cooler about  bottles of the usual liquor and mixers in the cooler. There was ice but it is not a good idea to use ice unless you know it was purified. No way to know that no one to ask. There were two bottles of Chinese ""Great Wall"" brand. One was dry red and the other was a cab. We tried the cab then switched to club soda. Star Alliance airlines should inspect this lounge and demand that Air China make necessary changes to bring it up to international standards. If you are going to use the Air China Beijing Lounge don't expect too much.",3,-0.232618709
R McCuaig,This is a great place to be  hours before your flight very quiet not around a lot of people. Many drink choices band a lot of food choices very comfortable and relaxing.,4,0.550519389
A Tran,The lounge near the rock wall was the one I enjoyed the most. Wonderful selection of drinks food selection decent but only light foods. WiFi was excellent.,4,0.550519389
N Ward,Quiet peaceful and comfortable place to sit. Have never experienced it to be too busy. The decor is new and it is always kept clean. Food area has lots of space and selection is the best I have experienced of any North American airport. Despite all of the shortcomings of this airport the Maple Leaf Lounges here are by far the best experience.,5,1.333657488
Weiyuan Tan,Quite spacious and busy lounge with nearly all facilities a passenger can demand. Luggage storage computer stations comfortable resting area hot food beverages separate sleeping/shower/TV rooms and digital flight information board. Since it is located on F you can also have a good view of the T terminal. There is another new Air China domestic lounge located in F no hot food is on offer but the lounge is much quieter.,4,0.550519389
D Goodwin,"I waited one hour at the JAL lounge between gates  and . The lounge was comfortable enough with WiFi internet connections bathrooms and comfortable chairs. What I found very disappointing was the food. Apart from a few croissants a few cookies and a cauldron of clam chowder there was no food. There were two ""no Halal"" signs that I found rather funny. One was funny because it was set up amongst the few croissants and cookies - nothing was halal because there was almost nothing there I thought. The other was set up amongst all the bottles of spirits at the wet bar. Gee couldn't they find any halal alcohol? At this lounge JAL comes off looking cheap.",3,-0.232618709
H Stevens,Was there on a stop-over from Singapore to Beijing. Very nicely decorated lounge. Comfortable seats. TV screen with Chinese channel. Separate smoking room. Not a quiet lounge all announcements with flight information given on the speakers (since this a busy airport there are continuous and very loud announcements). Very poor food choice (one soup  oriental dishes and some breads and instant noodles) for food. No wine only drinks in cans (including some beers) coffee tea. Staff with no smiles at all tables only cleaned after persons leave (I was there for  hours). No real complaints apart from the noise.,4,0.550519389
P Rubenstein,Dirty no food selection crowded with no place to sit. Unappealing decor. Stayed  minutes and then left to sit in the public area.,1,-1.798894906
John Kneijber,Nice looking large lounge with comfortable seating. Nice greeting on entering. Very good selection of drinks but food options limited and poor. Carrot and celery sticks and mountains of crackers. Only hot option was an unappealing soup and this was at dinner time.,4,0.550519389
D Mori,We went to this lounge first thing in the morning because we had an early flight. The are supposed to open at : am and the door was still locked and the lights off when we arrived. We were let in about  minutes after and the girl was just putting things out. There really wasn't a big selection of food. There was tea coffee juice and she put out bread for toast terribly sweet muffins (in packages) and flavoured bagels none plain. There was also cereal. That was about it. I would not want to go there again. The lounge seemed old and in need of an update.,3,-0.232618709
H Stevens,Very nice and quiet when we were there. Big issue is that warm food is only served from . till . and . till .. Too bad if your flight is at .. Some snacks available and limited beverages ( choices of tea) coffee coke fanta beer juices one choice of red wine/white wine. If you want something hot there are instant noodles. Free wireless okay and fast. No TV screens no announcements of flights. Good staff service though.,4,0.550519389
R Musgrave,Its okay but does not come close to First class lounges of other Asian airlines (eg Cathay Thai ANA etc). The staff here were miserable - no smiles no chat ... no nothing really except to check the boarding pass / invitation as if it was a top secret document. Hot food was available at one end of the lounge but this is geared totally to Chinese style and little else on offer. The washrooms have TV on the wall and annoying cleaning staff that stand around expecting you to give them a tip !? Certainly not a memorable lounge and had expected better from Air China since this is really quite new in ?,2,-1.015756808
M Lars,Nice Lounge but when you ask for Champagne nobody knows what is champagne! The white and red wine was around - weeks open and not drinkable. No food - only peanuts and other nuts. People are very polite but do not understand English. Internet WLAN works . Only small smoking room - no smoking lounge.,3,-0.232618709
J Lynch,Way too crowded! The place was packed at : and stayed that way when we left at :. Two planes including ours had slight delays. The food selection was nice especially the Thai soup. Because it was so busy the cleaning staff had a lot of work and empty dishes sat for - minutes. There didn't seem to be a place for us to drop off our used plates. Good selection of magazines and newspapers.,4,0.550519389
K Chen,A very disappointing lounge which I have used several times for the past four years. Nothing much has changed in the period. Granted is a domestic terminal lounge but given the number of people who use it it is far too small. There are many international passengers who connect at YVR but there is not even a shower for people to freshen up after a +hr flight! There is no separate area for people who want to take a rest and because of the large number of people present it is very crowded and noisy-- not much different from the terminal building itself. Food is pretty average and always the same salad and soup options (but nothing vegetarian!).,3,-0.232618709
V Hinkov,Very spacious lounge with lots of comfortable seating and pleasant ambiance. Good selection of drinks snacks vegetables and dips. I've only used it in the evening when they also offer good pasta dishes and some salads. Staff is friendly. Only critique is that internet connection is often rather slow.,4,0.550519389
Shane Tarr,Very basic lounge with little by way of food selection - mostly packaged foodstuffs - and very limited beverages. Even the Chinese Tea is of poor quality. Reading materials even in Chinese language are very limited and no internet access. However it does have a toilet with a heated seat! Because the airport has an open departure gate system probably few advantages spending time in this lounge.,2,-1.015756808
H RUTZ,In general this is a very dreary lounge. Very crowded on all of my visits making it difficult to find a seat. Rather dark with no natural light. Snack and beverage is all right but donâ€™t expect anything filling. Access to an internet connection is nearly impossible with people waiting turns. Smoking section is enclosed but very small and the smoke comes back into the large room. Not pleasant for either the smokers (no room) or the non-smokers. In general I have found sitting at the gate to be happier experience.,2,-1.015756808
A Murray,This lounge is big and well designed. Business centre with printing. Great selection of food snacks and drinks. Comfortable leather chair with foot rest in a mood room makes you a little too relaxed! I wish they had dedicated wifi for the lounge rather than using the general airport wifi which is fine but slow. Boarding announcements in a non intrusive way. For me this is the best AC lounge.,4,0.550519389
T Love,Excellent Lounge for North American standards. Drink selection very good food is usually rather light (salads and soups) but good. The weak point is the breakfast which is just cereals muffins and toast without any cheese ham or similar. They have an espresso / cappuccino machine producing excellent coffee. Free internet connection fast for Air Canada Elites usually works well unless the lounge is packed which can happen during peak hours.,5,1.333657488
STEVE BANINCZKY,Lounge had comfortable lounge chairs. Food was also adequate with hot and cold dishes. sandwiches and rolls in the fridge along with Beer and soft drink. Spirits also available. Not a large room however a good place to get away from the masses unless you needed a smoke.,3,-0.232618709
JEFF PUG,Air China's international business class lounge is rudimentary at best. There are separate lounges for first & business class passengers. There is complimentary internet access but this tended to be very slow. Open bar & light snacks are available. The room does not seem to be staffed adequately to handle the large number of passengers using the facilities as garbage & dirty dishes lingered for considerable amounts of time. Seating is very primitive arranged in rows of seats like a regular waiting room.,3,-0.232618709
T Love,Very old school menu hasn't been updated in God knows how long. The dishwasher broke so plastic utensils styrofoam cups and plates were used instead. Despite there being  other lounges in the airport to bring equipment from. Air Canada service continues to crumble.,2,-1.015756808
J Beece,When YVR was a single terminal airport the Maple Leaf Lounges were larger,,
M Norton,I have used this lounge many times and love it. Spacious and modern with nice touches like original glass sculpture in the bathrooms and light but good food choices and self serve bar. A world apart from any US airline lounge I have been to where food means pre-packaged tasteless cookies and a pay bar.,4,0.550519389
Sean Clarke,"This was a Priority pass lounge - not Air France! Comfortable enough but the food offerings here are as basic as you can get. A couple of ordinary sandwiches, some fruit and one type of a small maderia cake. The staff weren't in any rush to replenish either. Lazy lounge. Food and service.",3,-0.232618709
S Lerche,This lounge is a complete joke - cramped poor food selection beyond carrot sticks tomatoes soup and stale looking bread. Some breakfast snack items are ok. Can mix your own drink - oh joy. Coffee and cappuccino is fair. Looks dated and worn. Staff moderately helpful. Embarrassing (my home airport) when compared to other airports around the world.,3,-0.232618709
B Graham,A disgrace there is no plausible reason to use this facility. The coffee is terrible food non-existent no showers apparently domestic has this for some reason and average business facilities. Staff at reception are friendly enough but that appears to be the limit of the hospitality. Wifi is now pointless as you can easily source it from many different services within the airport.,2,-1.015756808
B Lafond,Spacious and quiet lounge with a wide range of quality food and alcohol including champagne. Enjoyable experience. Friendly staff.,5,1.333657488
Marc Moehli,Nobody at CDG airport seems to know where the AF arrival lounge is - they made my walk around for nearly one hour with plenty of luggage and I was unable to find. No signs anywhere.,1,-1.798894906
Pierre Lebellegard,One of the best lounges I have experienced. There are enough showers rooms. This is valuable as I usually come in this lounge before (or after) a -hour flight. I would have rated it * but the buffet especially drinks is a little bit skimpy.,4,0.550519389
Malcolm Norton,All Maple Leaf Lounges at Trudeau are appalling. Domestic is old and cold and needs a refit and the other lounges are a mess newspapers and used plates and wineglasses just left. I broke my rule and connected through Montreal yesterday. Considering the new Terminal One at Pearson is such a nice experience Montreal Trudeau is a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
Eric Wang,The lounge is within the acceptable range variety of food were served but some of them were poor in taste. The shower facility was very limited only  showers were provided and passenger need to ask the lounge staff to unlock the shower door. WI-FI and high-speed internet connection were provided computers and business facility were also available. Chairs were comfortable and few of them were recliners. Overall speaking the lounge is still fair but not the best one I've been to.,3,-0.232618709
David Hazen,"The Maple Leaf lounge has been a very good ""office away from the office"" facility including free wifi a bowl of hot soup and the like. In a recent fit of penny-pinching Air Canada has started demanding that users purchase internet access using a credit card. It is not a huge sum - $. - just enough annoy you especially when you know that you will have a fight with the accountants to claim it back. I sure hope that the pennies they accumulate from this change offset the costs associated with customer dissatisfaction.",2,-1.015756808
A Smith,It's worth noting that it very much depends on the terminal,,
Jonathan Dinh,This is a sorry excuse for a lounge. Drinks are plentiful but there was  sandwich when I walked in and an hour later still  sandwich. There were no plugs to recharge electronics and when I asked they directed me to unplug a lamp and use the socket! This is Air France's home country and this lounge is the best they've got? Quite sad as it is no better than a waiting room.,2,-1.015756808
Paul Browne,This place hasn't changed for years. Shower rooms are large and clean but had a really bad smell - like the sewer had backed up. The staff are welcoming but if I hadn't arrived so early and knew that my hotel room would not be ready I think I would just go straight to the hotel. Food offerings really limited in a small crowded room.,3,-0.232618709
Paul Browne,One of the nicest lounges I've seen with great breakfast offerings and superb staff. And then there's the views!,5,1.333657488
Emile Therrien,I'm surprised at people complaining about food in Maple Leaf lounge. Air Canada provides comfort food (soup cookies bagels) free drinks internet access a great selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge in Vancouver has a stunning view of the North Shore mountains - lounge in Edmonton has a fireplace - lounge in Ottawa is glass on  sides. Admittedly the domestic lounge in Toronto is often crowded with slow check-in. The international lounge there is soaring.,4,0.550519389
Tammy Karten,We flew Aeromexico Business class from JFK to Mexico City On March . Since the Aeromexico and Air France have a SkyTeam alliance agreement we went to Air Franceâ€™s Business Lounge in Terminal  at JFK. The lounge is small and clean and does offer relaxation time before boarding. One can sit in a deep cushion chair place food on the table or use the complimentary computers. Food offerings on March   started with stale roast beef/cheese sandwiches that came from the deep freeze cheap corn chips and packaged cookies one can find in a Supermarket etc. Champagne and other alcoholic and soft drinks were available in ample quantity. The coffee was good and so strong.,3,-0.232618709
C Wajsberg,Noticed a small improvement in the food served here in this lounge I visit regularly. If you use this lounge after pm you might enjoy a light meal . Choices  days ago were a nice beef roulade salad and or grilled vegetables. Soup is also available usual cheese and cake for desert. Much better food then before in this lounge and more fun eating here then food served in airplanes at  am. Alcohol wines etc are excellent â€¦If only Air France would see to it there would be some decent food all day long instead of having chocolate chip cookies from pm to pm this would be a further much appreciated improvement.,4,0.550519389
N Lawrence,Absolutely appalling. Dreadful food and tables covered with dirty plates and glasses that the non- existent staff have failed to remove. Quite the worst lounge I have ever been in.,2,-1.015756808
Robin Correa,Rather disappointed with the lack of breakfast choices when I used this lounge for an early morning flight. Bread butter muffin and a small bowl of fruit which emptied very quickly and took the attendants ages to top up. Coffee and tea only beverage choices with just  jug of orange on display. The Maple Leaf lounge had a rather' stingy' feel overall would not use it again.,2,-1.015756808
K Tunnicliffe,Very pleasant lounge close to our departure gate. Food somewhat limited but my daughter enthused about the soup (only hot dish on offer). Seating comfortable and ranged from lounge chairs to dining with a good few recliners as well. Business services were excellent with swift internet access. Sadly only two showers for the whole of this busy lounge and you have to ask the reception staff to unlock them and then wait while they find a cleaner to re-stock and clear up after the last occupant!,3,-0.232618709
K Tunnicliffe,This is one of the poorest lounges I have visited. The seats are worn food on offer consisted of a bowl of soup (in fairness very nice) and some cheese and very tired looking salad. There are no showers in this lounge which really surprised me. Not much of an advert for Air Canada at all. Staff were enthusiastic and pleasant.,2,-1.015756808
P Browne,Had a five hour stopover between flights. No problems using this lounge for that length of time. Very spacious lounge with plenty of seating and tables for dining. Food provided was of the snack/light meal variety but was good quality. Champagne and wine available on a help your self basis. Toilet and shower facilities were excellent with really good shower lots of hot water at high pressure and good amenity pack provided. All in all an excellent oasis of calm in a very busy airport.,5,1.333657488
C Wajsberg,very small elevators as stairs to get to this lounge which is not that easy to find but i know my way around cog terminal e gate L OR K. Lounge is small surely for the crowd that makes usage of this lounge. Lounge is dark and not clean . it was early morning so food choice was poor choice as usual in cog airport  croissant  pain au chocolate cereals and something a new a chocolate that has no chocolate taste. Coffee and espresso machine seems to be in need of repair as what i received from this coffee maker had no coffee taste . For those wanting boost early in the morning everything available as soft drinks . As usual af lounge leaves me wondering why do I bother.,3,-0.232618709
Ken Duffin,Dreadful. Avoid this lounge if you can. Looks like a temporary facility. Food was dreadful staff were invisible as were the facilities.,2,-1.015756808
C Young,Buried in the basement of CDG this lounge gets extremely crowded at times. Two flights a day to Canada and if one is delayed then it is sitting room on the floor only. Food not bad croissants cheeses yogurts etc. for breakfast and some sandwiches later on in the day plus the usual array of drinks. The lone staff person was excellent although it is ridiculous that those of us with connections that we are going to miss because of delays cannot be rebooked onto another flight. We have to wait till we get to Canada to be rebooked making everyone very cranky.,3,-0.232618709
D Chan,Limited view of the apron. Newspaper/food/drink selections minimal. Good business facilities. Toilet facility inadequate and was not kept clean.,2,-1.015756808
Jeremy Weiss,This small lounge is also used by Air France at times and quickly becomes overcrowded. The rest of Terminal  at LAX is even more congested. Public washrooms are located outside the lounge but are well-maintained. Good selection of self-serve beverages but food is limited to cheese and crackers. Large west-facing windows provide nice views but only two have pull-down shades. As a result the lounge becomes too hot. Tattered furniture needs replacing.,3,-0.232618709
Alan James,La Premiere Lounge at CDG is probably the best airport lounge I have experienced. Limo transfer direct from disembarkation gate on arrival from long haul flight. Air France staff accompanies to the dedicated security lane inbound to lounge. In the lounge enjoy the Alain Ducasse restaurant some exceptional wine. Beautifully restful chaise longue area with subdued lighting for resting. Toilets and showers are a work of art. Nice bathrobes and slippers with top of the range cosmetics/shower products. Agent drives you to the steps of your departing plane for the next sector.,5,1.333657488
R Dejan,Crowded and hard to find a place to sit. Washrooms dirty and small for size of lounge. Food service non existent but decent choice of soft drinks available. Overall not impressive and rather poor offering from a reputable air carrier.,1,-1.798894906
C Young,Very nice small lounge at Heathrow. Good continental breakfast available excellent showers and  computers. What makes this lounge special is the excellent staff friendly and helpful. Every time I use this lounge is it very empty could be because it is located outside the terminal a short walk from the arrivals area.,4,0.550519389
S Wheeler,The Toronto Pearson lounge was not very good food wise. I guess they assume everyone would prefer to drink then eat. If you like alcohol then this is the place for you if you don't then take snacks with you.,3,-0.232618709
A Pyne,This lounge was recently opened and is quite nice and very bright inside. It has almost  Degree windows which allow light in. As with most Maple Leaf lounges the food is almost non existent. I was there between -AM and there was only some bread for toasting and some yogurt and granola. The business center was good with several computers connected to the internet and several places to dock personal computers. Overall I would say this lounge is much better than the old one.,4,0.550519389
T Casse,Very poor facilities old lounge what are they doing? Very poor services friendliness cleanliness etc.,2,-1.015756808
Olivier Ragu,I took the opportunity to test the new AF lounge at the newest boarding satellite called S. A completely new experience from the other lounges I have visited at CDG. Very large seperated in several areas with a real bar with the usual selection and great wines and a first for any AF lounge a self service Hot food corner including some risotto pasta cold meat and some pastries for dessert. A huge step from the S lounge. No problem at all to find a table or a sofa to rest. Plenty of working space and reading material too. Modern design with a nice view on the tarmac. Hope they would upgrade the other lounges the same way!,4,0.550519389
J Ho,Kind of a fail. This lounge is dated worn and desperately needs air conditioning. The leather chairs are worn and dirty. The wi-fi is slower than the general free Frankfurt Airport wi-fi and just outside the lounge is a long hallway with recliners for regular passengers to lounge in comfort. The only places to sit in the lounge for lounge customers are upright chairs. Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched. I found this whole wine selection to be odd. Air France needs to spend a little effort at improving this lounge in my opinion.,2,-1.015756808
K Kandola,Very good lounge as there was a variety of canapÃ©s and drinks. Lounge staff were happy to help with any of your needs.,6,2.116795586
C Wajsberg,Lounge is easy to find and close to gate but lounge is still the same lounge as I have visited to many times when flying from this airport. Not so comfortable chairs that are already showing there usage. Cheap South African wine and some sandwiches chips crackers and some cheese. Not really a place to enjoy relax after working all day and still having to fly  hours. Wifi improved and is working very well now.,4,0.550519389
L Wiesenfeld,A few seats uncomfortable. No decent food coffee and tea from coin machines. Some newspapers. Such a minimal lounge that I now avoid it and use the open bars and cafes of the airport far better and friendlier.,2,-1.015756808
M Lopez,Old and crowded lounge always full. They have  flights ( AF and one KLM) departing early evening so the space is not enough for all passengers. The food is mediocre and there is only one old shower in urgent need of renovation.,3,-0.232618709
Gupta Aparajita,My daughter and I took the AI from LHR to Delhi. I have never seen a worse spread of snacks in any lounge before. We had to go downstairs to a cafe to get a bite. Food was stale and cold.,1,-1.798894906
K Khanna,This is the only lounge I have seen which is before the security so if you are at highest member level or are flying business class you need to reach little early if you wish to use the lounge. The purpose of relaxing at lounge and boarding when boarding starts will not stand true in this case. Odd and strange it is but this is Air India you can expect anything. The reason I can think of is if you visit their lounge you would notice that it is generally occupied by Airline staff itself and after a minute or two someone will be visiting from Airline to have a snack so it is a free restaurant for them. Last month I sent them a mail that their lounge plugs are not working from months.,3,-0.232618709
S Sela,I arrived in the early morning from Toronto to Heathrow on Air Canada and was transferring to Air India flight to Delhi. The lounge does not open until  hours prior to the flight which meant I could not use the lounge for several hours. Most airlines use partner lounges when their lounge is not open. The lounge itself isn't too bad but is small and has little services.,2,-1.015756808
F Zaidan,We used the business class lounge of Charles de Gaulle as transit passengers. The experience was horrible. Dirty seats empty bags and paper glasses no choice in food just some packaged stuff. Plus the lounge was crowded. On the way back the lounge was almost empty but the manager decided to prevent us from getting in with  and  yrs old children (who were on economy class tickets). All in all my experience with Air France is way below average.,2,-1.015756808
Thuto Moloi,The lounge is okay and I get to do my work without interruptions or noise. However in the morning and there is no food - just snacks I thought by now with all the complaints something would be different. People care about food they want to eat Air France please listen to your customers!!,4,0.550519389
C Bourdon,A charming stewardess picks you up at the incoming flight taking you to this dedicated Lounge. A butler welcoming you a Michelin starred restaurant with perfect service and outstanding wines. The quality of showers massage is like a hotel. All passport formalities completed in the lounge.,5,1.333657488
Liezel Groenewald,No Soft drinks! No towels to shower with! Toilets are dirty. By far the worst Star Alliance lounge we have been to.,1,-1.798894906
D Whalley,What a depressing place! This lounge is definitely not to be recommended for a long transit. Having recently been condemned to staying in the lounge for  hours I cannot recommend this lounge. The food was practically non existent. Just one badly bruised banana and a single rotting orange and a few snacks. There was butter and jam but no bread until morning. When I asked for the use of the shower I was made to feel it was putting the staff out. Staff were few and far between and totally disinterested in customer service. The decor is outdated and dirty. Wifi is available but so complicated to connect it is worthless. There is little to redeem this lounge.,1,-1.798894906
D Whalley,The lounge is clean. Seating adequate. There is a meagre but reasonable selection of snacks and drinks. WiFi available. Staffing limited and they seem disinterested.,3,-0.232618709
D Brown,One of the worst I have been in. It is very small and has the most uncomfortable chairs. Before international flights in the evening it is packed. People walking around trying to find a seat. The bathrooms are small and dirty. Food selection is minimal. Plenty of cold drinks. Do not pay extra to get into this lounge.,2,-1.015756808
G Schultink,"Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato As a regular JNB passenger I visit this lunge often. The worst part are the most uncomfortable seats - the seat are designed to make a ""statement"" but are the most uncomfortable ever experienced among many business lounges around the world. Air France should look at their KLM partner lounges in AMS and its seat / electric outlet convenience (still no international plugs - they require adapters). Food and beverage selection is decent and so is the internet functionality. Men's bathroom typically dirty sometime lacking supplies.",3,-0.232618709
A Sutcliffe,Absolutely diabolical. The food selection is virtually non-existent unless you like potato crisps/chips. What food there is (cold slabs of processed pork a bowl of mini-gherkins and some awful sandwiches) is desperately low quality. There is no service within the lounge itself which is sterile and uncomfortable. In AF's home country at their home airport this is a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
J Dee,If you want to feel depressed about your choice of airline Air India's Business Lounge in Delhi International will do it for you. Curry or Curry with rice for a meal. Samosas in an oven that had been there for at least a week.  beers in the fridge dirty plates stacked everywhere toilets that need a pressure cleaner desperately. Truly third world and nowhere near international standards. Flickering or dead light fixtures tired interior no staff no food if you are sick of curry just no point. Got so sick of the depressing place I went next door and paid to use another lounge.,1,-1.798894906
L Berryman,Poor service. Imagine the frustration of getting off an overnight flight and finding the lounge closed at .am (their website specifies an .am opening time). With no indication of 'when' they would be open casual discussion with others in the area indicated a am opening!,1,-1.798894906
Menon Nalini,Was shocked at the condition of the place. Staff were incredible wonderful. No complains abt them. The sofas were all stained. No way anyone could rest there. So small and people were talking so loudly children screaming. No wifi at all. Staff kept apologising to us - it was not their fault. We could not even entertain ourselves with our mobile or tabs (as wifi was totally out). Food was horrible. Coffee machine made alot of noise. No proper reading material. A lady was bringing the roof down saying she was economy but wanted to sit inside and rest. Finally we left this dirty lounge and went to the main seating area near the gates. Tried to buy some food to eat hardly could eat because pigeons were over our heads and that was so unhealthy. We left out food and drinks (which we bought) and went to wait at the gate. We just cannot believe that an International airport is in such a state. The finale is the toilet next to the Lounge - it was like a public toilet. I have to indicate a star at least below otherwise I cannot proceed to submit this. I dont wish to give a star at all for anything below except  stars for the poor staff to deal with all this.,1,-1.798894906
M Carpenter,Pretty awful. Food is very poor and coffee is truly dreadful. Decor is ugly fittings are falling off the walls staff are invisible (debris stays at tables for hours).,2,-1.015756808
C Wajsberg,It seems that most lounges from Air France I visit suffer from the same acute problem. Food quality and choice is ridiculous compared with lounges from other airlines. AF lounge in Paris terminal E food choice is very poor and cheap quality. Most food there is cheap sandwiches crackers and chips. Choice of drinks is ok even if wine quality could be better to even much better.,3,-0.232618709
M Lopes,The lounge in F at CDG is a shame as the terminal F itself. In the entrance the welcome speech from the staff is almost an apology about the lounge situation. One floor was closed so the remaining space was totally crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the end facing bathrooms. Very limited food choice only cold croissants and nuts crisps. There were only one shower  minutes wait time.,3,-0.232618709
S Kumar,I have been using Delhi international airport biz/first class lounge for last two years on way to US and Asia. Pathetic food and same menu. Internet is always down when asked why it is down for  years no answer. Selection of alcohol is very sad papers/magazines variety is limited. Too many people working but not working think there are three managers for every person working. Overall disappointing.,1,-1.798894906
Menon Nalini,Executive Lounge for Air India in Changi Airport Terminal  was very comfortable. Wonderful variety of food coffee tea etc. Fruits Sandwiches.  exercise lounge chairs. Good wifi connection. Polite staff and helpers inside the lounge. Though we had to wait for  over hours we enjoy the comfort in this lounge. I even had a good  over hour of sleep to make up for getting up early to come to the airport. Lovely clean toilets.,5,1.333657488
D Phukan,Air India Terminal  international Lounge is very spacious clean and well kept facility. The staff were courteous and helpful. The sofa and slumber lazboys were comfortable for napping and taking a break. Food was fresh tasty but selection was a little limited. The drinks and beverage selection was good and the staff brought it to my sitting area (maybe local regulations about an open bar). The internet connectivity with Tatadocomo was challenging - one of the lounge staff members had to help me connect. The toilet and showers were clean. I can see the lounge getting very busy and crowded in the future. But for me it was a good experience and a pleasant surprise.,4,0.550519389
C Chouleur,The design is very trendy and it offers nice views on the apron. It is divided in several zones depending on what you are looking for. Usually AF lounges are not very good for the catering but this one offers a wide choice of food and drinks. I took advantage of the Clarins Spa that is free. It's now time for Air France to offer a consistent product and offer the same comfort and quality and choice of food in all their lounges.,5,1.333657488
D Rose,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips. I do my best to avoid Air France but sometimes I have no other option.,3,-0.232618709
Mark Ackery,Flew with Icelandair who use this new Air France lounge. Staff in lounge very friendly food was sandwiches and nuts. Food well presented bar staffed at all times this I thought was not good as I like to get my own drinks. Showers great and very refreshing water hot and shower room was well cleaned. If I had one complaint I would say the seating looks like old school chairs. Great views from the big windows of the aircraft coming and going. I also imagine that with a A the lounge would be cramped and very busy - Lucky only  B's on my departure day.,4,0.550519389
Vikramaditya Singh,I was traveling first class to US from Delhi and had  h to spend in the Air India lounge. I was shocked to see that this is the flagship lounge of Air India in India's capital. What a shame. First the first and Executive lounges are not separate. They are separated by a barricade nthat was easily crossed. There is no wait staff even for first class passengers. When one flies Emirates or Lufthansa in first class the respective lounges provide an opportunity for a high quality sit down meal from an a la carte menu. In the AI lounge food left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was in shambles and there was no lotion. Magazine choice was non existent. Wifi was spotty and complicated. why can't they provide free wifi without the need for passwords cell phones etc ? Very absurd. And the bar service was pitiful and most of the time non existent. Again no waiters even in first class section. In summary the premium lounge in the airport shared by many airlines is similar but at least predictable in service (albeit poor). The AI lounge is awful and takes away from first class experience. The managers don't care and are never around to receive feedback leave alone make changes. Best avoided for same reason AI is best avoided. First class pax are not escorted to the plane either.,1,-1.798894906
A Parameswaran,"Had a  hour layover in Delhi while returning from Frankfurt and going to Hyderabad. The lounge was easy to find and the ambience was quite decent with enough seating. However every aspect of service is poor. I asked for a toothbrush in the morning
D Whalley,A large but outdated lounge. Furniture adequate but showing signs of wear and tear. The lighting poor with many light bulbs flashing on and off. Food is basic with little choice. Toilet areas kept clean but no facilities for a wash after a long flight. There are showers but these were closed and out of use. I asked for a shaving kit. Told they are available but none left 'sorry'. Only computer access is via three outdated computers. Staff kept the lounge clean and tidy. This is not however up to modern standards. This is not a place to enjoy a long transit.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Ray Sani,Clean and roomy lounge not much selection for food around and usual drinks selections. Nothing special for the time I was there.,4,0.5505193893044773

Mark Wilkins,Air India use the Louis Tavern lounge in Bangkok airport which is open to the general public on payment. There are very limited facilities in the lounge (no TV no toilets) but a better drinks and food selection than either the Air India lounges used on this trip or the Thai lounges used in Bangkok before. Wifi good and accessed via passkeys provided at reception to lounge. Aircraft boarding information needs improvement though. Not busy despite the amount of people in the airport that morning.,4,0.5505193893044773
E Cuignet,The lounge was airy with good food. Plenty of quality wines. The wi-fi connection was efficient. Toilets were clean. The lounge is close to the boarding gate. This made for a pleasurable experience.,3,-0.23261870920862976
C Stone,This lounge is small but quiet most of the time. The front desk assistant was friendly and made sure to make announcements about flights which were boarding. The snacks are fresh and delicious. The bar selection was not extensive but there is a reason for this - If you want a drink such as champagne or a caipirinha just ask! The restrooms were small but clean. There was constant removal of empty plates glasses etc. The internet was very slow during the peak hours but at other times the internet speed was fair.,4,0.5505193893044773
C Wajsberg,Lounge is used by many airlines too many for the size of the lounge even if I got lucky this time and found a good seat. The lounge is used by so many airlines that announcements for flight boarding are going on forever - maybe they should learn from other lounges and make this one a silent one. Food quality is poor and choice is at the same disappointing level. Drinks consist of cans and bottles that are presented in a very small refrigerator - meaning the cans have no time to become col. Wine served is local brew. Lets hope for a Skyteam lounge in new terminal. Wifi is very badly organised and only  computers available.,3,-0.23261870920862976
D Simmonds,Air Mauritius have the use of the Air France lounge in Johannesburg. The lounge was small and very quiet. The seating was of modern design to the point of being weird looking (imagine + IKEA designs) and too close together. Other than reception staff ( ladies who were clearly uninterested in customer service) I did not see a single attendant/waiter. The food was boring limited cold and stale. The coffee (from an automated machine) was quiet OK though. Of the  available PC's for client use only  were working. Those  had such a slow response time for internet surfing that I didn't achieve anything anyway. The screen savers timed out the sessions as well.,2,-1.0157568077217367
D Simmonds,The Air Mauritius lounge at Port Louis is as expected for the national airline's home lounge large well-equipped and has a warm welcoming feel. The food is excellent quality and plentiful with staff more than happy to assist.,5,1.3336574878175844
Mark Wilkins,Visited whilst in international transit. Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi  up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory ( veg  meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!). Wifi is the airports and not the lounges - limited and very slow - had to use the dedicated terminals instead. Was again a good place to rest and read but not on a par with other carriers i have flown.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Mark Wilkins,Myself and fellow passengers entered this lounge  hours before the flight to be told the hot food would not be available for another  minutes. Good points - plenty of seating good wi-fi newspaper selection tv drinks selection notified when it was time to board. Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only  of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed. Recommend the lounge as an escape from the crowds but eat beforehand.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Derek Cox,This is not so much of a lounge as somewhere to sit while you wait for a flight. The bar or the lack of one was very disappointing as it was closed. How long it has been that way or if it would open again is anyone's guess. The cold drinks were dreadful food was hot but not a great selection. Okay if you only want Indian food but would be nice to have had a selection after all it was the international lounge with international passengers. The lounge at Heathrow T was better bright clean but a very limited selection of Indian food some biscuits and a few alcoholic drinks on show. Air India lounges are best forgotten.,2,-1.0157568077217367
C Wajsberg,Same old overcrowded lounge with same food and drinks (choice not very big or interesting) espresso machines are dirty and food is tasteless. Lounge is also used by people having a certain credit card. While waiting to get in and present your invitation one has to wait for the man in front of you deciding if he is going to charge his credit card with money or points.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Andrew Nethercott,Too small both the AF and KLM flights leave within a few minutes it is far too crowded. No power outlets seating not very comfortable lounge looks a bit worn. Drink selection just ok food not what you would expect of the French!,2,-1.0157568077217367
M Harris,This is without doubt the worst lounge as far as food is concerned. A pm flight and nothing to eat but crisps and dry cheese. Air France should be ashamed.,3,-0.23261870920862976
D West,Not a lot has changed since the review on here from  by the look of it. Used by Air France Emirates and Air Mauritius. Still  levels limited choice of food drink not bad. Handy for the departure gates only  metres away from Gate  for example. Plenty of flat screen large TVs dotted around the lounge but all switched off. Was quite crowded when we passed through with  flights departing at the end of the day. (It looks as if they are building another terminal next door to the current one so things will probably be improved all round when its finished.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Bernard Feissat,Small but cosy - no windows. Limited quantity and variety of food drinks ok as far as tea and coffee are concerned. Some place to store luggage. The business lounge is sort of a mezzanine above the first class lounge shared by Air Mauritius and Air France. Very easy to find right after immigration and security check and pretty close to boarding gate. Clean restrooms and clean and comfortable shower rooms - unfortunately just  internet PCs that are always busy.,4,0.5505193893044773
Derek Cox,This must be the worst lounge in existence a dreadful room to spend any time in. We had to ask for the air conditioning to be switched on as it was so hot and stuffy. The lounge had a old microwave oven in one corner that they (when we finally were able to find a staff member) could offer an instant coffee or a cup or tea. It looked nasty so we plumped for a small (very small) bottle of water we were also offered a biscuit. After a nine hour Air India flight with not a great deal to eat we were hungry but I am afraid that the cupboard was bare. Just to add that if you (like us) had to transit from the international to domestic a leave plenty of time as you will pass through a least  xray checks and a least  more security checks plus a  kilometer bus ride (packed like sardines) up three floors to the so-called lounge and then down one or two floors to your departure gate. We have to repeat it in December as we have already booked the flights. What you get for a cheap fare.,1,-1.7988949062348438
Val Lovell,This is the most miserable lounge I've ever been in. Furniture is falling to pieces no toilet paper in the ladies' toilet food terrible and staff as slow as a wet week. Awful coffee delivered after a long wait.,1,-1.7988949062348438
S Williams,The new Maharaja lounge just past security is still not open. I went to the Maharaja lounge by gate  passed security on th April . I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. I arrived in this Room full of mosquitoes old worn out furniture with people trying to sleep on the worn out shabby settees I do not know how they could sleep with all that noise and constant phone going off and people just entering the lounge asking questions about other air lines. They will only serve you water or juice as apparently they will not serve alcohol to business or first class passengers on International flights since st April so a dry room. When I arrived in this excuse of a lounge there were about  children screaming and running around without any supervision apparently they were being looked after by a member of staff so they were not booked as business or first class passengers she then moved them to a more suitable area after about  minutes. You have to ask for water or juice. I asked for tea and they do serve this. Snacks are from a microwave and again you have to ask but I would not recommend these over microwave snacks. I walked out and still cannot believe this so called first and business class lounge is still in use it should have been closed years ago.,2,-1.0157568077217367
A Johnson,A perfectly adequate lounge a bit small. Not as nice as the bigger E lounge but nice. Staff very friendly. Food fine - sandwiches yoghurt soup crisps and drinks. I enjoy the Air France lounges.,4,0.5505193893044773
Emile Okal,A good lounge with direct access to gate M usually the one used by the AF departure. Great supply of French newspapers adequate Wifi snacks/sandwiches usually OK Champagne very good (but has a tendency to run out quickly and staff less than enthusiastic about bringing new bottle).,4,0.5505193893044773
P de Jager,Terrible Lounge - no water in the toilets neither for washing hands. I used the only CL bottle at around . hrs. Was sitting close to the toilet entrance and observed that none of the lounge staff put a new bottle of water - during  hours (time of boarding). In the meantime people were walking in/out and of course did their thing without washing hands!,2,-1.0157568077217367
M Bomford,After the chaos confusion and long wait through immigration and security this was a shocking surprise. At first we wondered if we were in the right place. Dingy and old fashioned with no sign of any refreshments at all. No wifi and a Desk top that had to be repaired before it was usable. The toilet facilities were the worst we have seen in a so called Business Class lounge. While we were there some Indian people were offered a drink and light refreshments (so presume there was catering of some sort somewhere) but not us or other Europeans. A miserable alternative to the much better options just outside the door.,1,-1.7988949062348438
K Baker,I was shocked when entering the lounge because I wasn't sure if this was the correct place to be? Plenty of seats that look it's straight from the s-s but very little people except a few sleeping. The staff is polite though have trouble understanding English. I wasn't sure if there was food/drink available but noticed the staff asking an India passenger so I inquired. No Wi-Fi but there is one older PC with internet. I needed to use a phone to call a local number for confirmation and that was difficult to do because they couldn't figure out if I could or if I had to use someone's cell though the staff was helpful enough to let me borrow one of their mobile phones. I left after a short time as there were a couple of older TVs that were fairly loud. Overall I'd avoid this lounge and stick to the airport which is much nicer.,1,-1.7988949062348438
Ted Cho,Waiting for my flight from Mumbai to Singapore I was entitled to use the Maharaja Lounge since I was a business class passenger. There are two lounges that can be used one before security and one after. I chose to use the one after security because the lines were extremely long. The waiting area after security is very sparse but had an adequate number of seats. The lounge appeared decent from the outside. Once inside I felt I had entered into the s. There were sofas and chairs that were upholstered with a flower pattern. The tables and everything else was wood (mahogany?). The two young men manning the information desk took my lounge pass. I found a seat among the many people who had already taken entire sofas to sleep on. Being a midnight flight there were many sleeping people. There were no drinks or food offered in the open. One of the young men offered water to other passengers and I had to ask for water. Later on the young man was taking the order of another passenger and finally asked me if I wanted coffee or tea. The only redeeming factor of this lounge was that the Masala Chai was decent. Other than that I felt like I had been transported back to the s due to the furniture of the lounge. Also if other Indian passengers had not ordered coffee/tea I feel like I never would have been asked being the only non-Indian passenger in the lounge.,1,-1.7988949062348438
C Coveyduck,Malaysia Airlines use this lounge -small and shabby with uncomfortable seating. The choice of food and drinks was very poor. The staff were rather indifferent and off hand when we asked for more croissants. They were having a delivery of stock which was being wheeled through the lounge during the whole of the one and half hours we were there not a very relaxing atmosphere! There is no left luggage facility so if you want to shop you have to take you hand luggage with you. For a European Airport the standard of this lounge is shocking.,1,-1.7988949062348438
Emmanuel Cuignet,Lounge is really average and comparable to other AF lounges in CDG. The letdown is the poor quality of the food offered. It was lunch time we were provided with a meagre choice of soup sandwiches a slice of turkey and cheese. Needless to say every one rushed for food there was nothing left besides the usual chips and crackers. The lounge is big let down as E is the modern part of CDG.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Dirk Visser,Arriving at  the upper level was very full and everywhere you looked there were trays with empty cans wrappers napkins etc. Catering not that bad.

L Eames,The lounge in F at CDG is small and very crowded. The only seats we could find were at a table in the cafe area at the back.

Limited food choice some sandwiches nuts crisps etc. Are all AF lounges at CDG as abysmal as this?,2,-1.0157568077217367
M McGee,Air France business lounges in Terminal C and F are very similar. Upper Deck Closes at  adding to overcrowding of the small main lounge which at peak times is horrible overcrowded loud and noisy. Selection of drinks is limited sometimes there are some snacks (cheese baguettes fruits etc) which disappear within a few minutes because of the big amount of guests. Rest rooms are too small and Staff do not seem to be very motivated or even attempt to pretend they care! The feedback unit did not work which says it all.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Paul Van Alsten,Le Patiolounge is located on the st floor of Orly-Ouest Hall  just after the security check. Staff is very polite and friendly. Lounge is clean and seats are comfortable with a nice view on the apron. There are three free internet computers - all were working properly. Quite a large selection of newspapers but most of them in French and only two in English. The huge disappointment is the poor food and drinks. For hot drinks there are only vending machines - the same type as in gas stations. The choice for cold beverages is a bit larger but only small cans are offered. Forget about food - at any time of the day the lounge offers only chips or biscuits!,2,-1.0157568077217367
Justin Smith,The staff are reasonably polite but that's where the positives end. We were both starving when we got to the lounge at pm but there was no hot food. I then decided to have some cold food but there was hardly any of that either! What is the use of crackers without cheese or butter? Only Air France knows the answer to that. All they had was crisps. On complaining to the staff I was told since """"a few months ago"""" they only serve food at certain times. When they did eventually serve the much awaited fare it was tepid soup and that was about it.""",3,-0.232618709
B Coicadin,Basic lounge upstairs of the main alley in the terminal. No view except over the shopping corridor below. Limited range of food except crisps biscuits. Even during lunch hours disappointing. Drink range adequate so is the reading material. Couple of pc with free internet access good but faulty connection. Toilets are outside the lounge.,2,-1.015756808
Mahul Shah,Very modern looking retro lounge. It has several work stations and free wifi. Several staff had occupied one corner and were trying to hide while being noisy and consuming lounge food and beverages. Food included crisps fruit pies quiches sandwiches. There was a self service bar with wines beers soft drinks coffees sparkling wine and spirits. Good choice. Not too much reading material.,3,-0.232618709
M Matheson,I spent all day in this lounge on my trip from Canada to Perth and back and got to experience it from early morning to early evening. The showers were clean and well stocked and the food was amazing. There was lots of it and a wide variety of delicious restaurant quality items. Offerings changed at breakfast morning tea lunch afternoon tea and dinner and all were tasty and carefully presented. An onsite barista and an assortment of beverages made a long long layover a little more bearable. The only thing lacking was somewhere to recline and get some sleep.,5,1.333657488
Richard Dalgleish,"Not a good experience Despite Pudong having a lot of lounges passengers from several flights seem to be packed into just  so that the staff end up trying to find seats for guests. The welcome was poor along the lines of ""voucher sit down"". Food poor no white wine only red and a request for white was met with a simply ""no"". In the end we moved out To the main concourse as it is quieter more pleasant and far less crowded. What is the point of paying extra for this?",1,-1.798894906
A Hetier,"I wonder if we are talking about the same lounge here. There are two international terminals one for Saudi Arabian airlines and one for all other airlines. At the ""foreign"" international terminal the lounge was crowded and obviously too small but let's say it did the job: a seat free drinks free Wi-fi. Women can access the lounge and sit anywhere (it is not separate). There are large TV screens and staff announce flights on time.",2,-1.015756808
C Ward,I found the lounge to be excellent. The showers were clean and tidy seating comfortable. The snack food including gluten-free was excellent and main course was OK. Drinks excellent. The lounge was busy but not too crowded. Probably the only minus is the very loud and frequent airline announcements which make it difficult to speak on the phone.,5,1.333657488
J Lauterbach,Overall quite disappointing. The place is crowded dirty (trash on the floor seats are dirty dirty glasses and plates on many tables). The food selection is good if they have any (some offerings have been empty of  min now). No clean gasses for soda etc. Looks like they are trying to cut cost wherever possible. Wifi is incredibly slow.,2,-1.015756808
J Harris,The furniture is very worn but there are spaces to go to get away from the noise down one end. The toilets have a questionable aroma though and need an update with their chipped toilet seats. Food and drink selection is fairly basic but there is usually something to fill a snack gap before the flight. My favourite is the hotdog stand. Cleaning staff are diligent and clear dishes. It's better than sitting on a plastic chair at the gate.,4,0.550519389
K Losse,The lounge is pretty basic. Small not particularly well kept. Chairs are worn and electric outlets were not adapted to American plugs. The highlight of the lounge is the older man who works there who showed me how to pour my sweet Vermouth properly (over ice). Lounge has a decent supply of newspapers.,2,-1.015756808
F Butler,Good selection of food and drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic however the seats are the most uncomfortable I have even seen. This is definitely not a lounge you would want to spend a lot of time waiting for a flight! Their old lounge was far more comfortable. Air France need to look into making this more comfortable for passengers especially in this age when increasing security issues make longer stays at the airport more and more common.,3,-0.232618709
Martin Donovan,Uncomfortable crowded shared with KLM. Not many magazines. Packaged crackers and cookies. Really a drag. No WiFi and no computers provided.,2,-1.015756808
R Conibrium,I fly all the time and have been a Koru Club member for years. Things have deteriorated to the point where I feel compelled to write this review. I can only assume that there has been some serious cost cutting going on air Air NZ as the food served seems to mostly consist of whatever is cheap. It is rarely tasty or nutritious. Then theres the actual state of the lounges - they're increasingly threadbare. In fact it has got to the point where the actual airports public areas are often a better alternative. Air New Zealand has really gone down hill quite suddenly. It is a really sad thing to watch.,2,-1.015756808
M Duffy,Thai Airways uses Air NZ's Koru lounge at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. TG departs at  and it is sad to relate that this excellent lounge has very little to offer the business class traveler at the end of the day. Eats such as they were consisted of a very tired salad bowl a few biscuits and a bowl of fruit salad. In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day. In fact the whole of Tullamarine Airport at that late hour is a shambles. It was a highly disappointing experience.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Fitzgerald,Crowded and loud noise. School holidays and full of children. Given the very permissive nature of Koru club membership and size of all the Air NZ lounges in NZ this is not a good time to be a business traveller.,3,-0.232618709
G Mollison,The lounge has had a bit of an update which looks heaps better. I had the misfortune to meet the late night staff (duty manager I think) while trying to catch the Aus vs Fra rugby test before my flight to Singapore. A rather unpleasant experience all round. Not to mention the fact that she then got the departure gate staff to grill me when I boarded (as a result of the exchange in the lounge with the business lounge manager). Quite a miserable front to present to traveling public. I try to not fly Air New Zealand when I can help it amongst others for these reasons. unfortunately the Air New Zealand lounge hosts other airline business passengers so I will have to live with the luck of the draw as to who is on duty when I and others pass through AKL.,3,-0.232618709
William Delaney,Initially looked pleasant. Air con did not work properly. When I asked why I was told that they have no control over the temperature that they had complained countless times to the airport facilities management but no improvement. Food was from the buffet reminded me of a British Rail buffet carriage from the 's. Upholstery was in a state of complete disrepair dirty and dilapidated. If the airport outside the lounge were not such a nightmare glorified shopping mall I would not have stayed there.,2,-1.015756808
James Kennington,This lounge is small considering the number of airlines and flights it is supposed to accommodate. On my visit there were no seat available and I was forced to find a seat in what must have once been the business centre which is now a run down little room with a bench desk (no computers). Food options are limited but being breakfast there were scrambled eggs and beans available which weren't bad. Not a toaster in sight however. After the Auckland flight was called and those passengers had left the cleaning staff came out with portable vacuums and vacuumed for a good min which ensured there was no relaxation at all. This is a frequent occurrence in this lounge. Showers are available.,2,-1.015756808
John Kneijber,Air New Zealand use the Faa'a airport lounge in Papeete. Next time I'm not sure I would bother. The food offerings were poor. Actually mostly pre packaged snacks. If you want a beer or soft drink you'll be ok but don't expect any ice for spirits or mixers and don't dare ask a staff member for any ice. Staff are rude and abrupt. At least it's air conditioned unlike the rest of the airport.,2,-1.015756808
J de Fraine,Situated in the bowels of the terminal the ambience is gloomy and it looks very tatty and tired. Very uninspiring food (hot or cold) which isn't replenished as frequently as it should be. Dirty/used crockery stayed on tables way too long as staff were scarce. I visit this lounge fairly frequently and it's the same depressing experience. I don't know if it's bad feng shui poor design neglect or cost cutting but compared to other lounges even other Air NZ lounges this isn't one I look forward to visiting.,2,-1.015756808
B Harris,Very disappointing. No food lounge overcrowded. No plates or cups to get the limited food there was or make a coffee. Barista on duty but woefully out of their depth making  coffees. Air NZ staff happier gossiping around the front them providing assistance. No premium feel as overcrowded. Seating configuration forces people together and eliminates private space. Seen better lounges in Asia.,3,-0.232618709
Ken Duffin,A very nice lounge. Good food and drink selection not especially crowded and good facilities. A few signs indicating where it is would be helpful having said that as it's a star alliance lounge I think?,4,0.550519389
S Hayes,I used the lounge prior to a flight to Hong Kong very full with several flights leaving. Just  staff was trying to keep the place clean. Food selection was dire. The hot option ran out and not replaced for over an hour. Even the cheese and crackers ran out. Leaving only some very unappetising looking muffins and scones with some soup. There was plenty to drink that is always well stocked. The lounge and bathrooms were reasonably clean. I would like to see Air New Zealand up their game with this lounge. For what is charged per annum for a Koru membership a lot more should be provided.,3,-0.232618709
T Collier,Fantastic lounge. Plenty of seat choices and a large food/beverage area. Staff keep the place impeccably clean â€“our empty cup/plate was removed what felt like seconds after you finished. We arrived just at the end of the breakfast service but you could still pick up some items off that menu â€“ cheese & bacon muffins were delicious! The soft drinks were dispensed via a soda machine and my only quibble was that the glasses could have been done with being bigger. The ones there were more for adding a mixer to alcohol than someone just having a soft drink. Good free unlimited wifi too once you get the password from the receptionist on the way in.,5,1.333657488
Mathias Stolzenberg,Very pleasant experience. Good selection of hot and cold dishes. Above average selection of wines and beers. Clean and good shower facilities. Very handy after long haul intercontinental flight from Europe with international onward flight.,4,0.550519389
V Naidoo,Currently at the Sydney Koru Lounge awaiting my flight. The facilities meet all the necessary requirements (incl showers internet ample space) and on par with that of the AirNZ lounge in Auckland. While the 's styled furniture could use a facelift the quality of the food and service is brilliant.,4,0.550519389
J Brezovec,Dinner menu - reconstituted chicken meat crumbed (called them chicken burgers) and wedges that were rock hard the only hot food on offer. One plate of cold cuts were the cold offering for the first five clients in the lounge - never re filled. My husband suggested Mcdonalds would offer more variety and fresher food. Very disappointing is the only thing we can say.,2,-1.015756808
Chris Ford,Visited with our toddler before a long haul flight and were very pleased. Along with a solid food and drink selection and announcements for all Star Alliance flights there is a kids room with plenty of toys crayons paper etc. we were there for an hour and had staff clean away dishes three times. It is basically the exact opposite of United lounges.,4,0.550519389
S Strong,It is tired tatty and ill-conceived (where I was sitting I could hear at least two tv's simultaneously and the clatter of pool balls.) I picked up the seat cushion to try to make myself more comfortable - let's just say I don't think anyone has done that in a long time there were a fair few renegade peanuts bits of paper and dust under there. The carpets and fabrics are well past their best (I don't think cushions with holes in them is a good look). It is self service at the bar and buffet. There was very little choice of food and what there was unappetising and the presentation needed tidying up the platters were virtually empty the pancake machine was surrounded by cast-off pancake pieces. It really seemed like just the scraps were left. It appears that if you want to clean your teeth you ask the person on reception!,2,-1.015756808
Tom Vanderbee,Air New Zealand use the Eva Air lounge and it is not very good. The lounge itself is big enough but all available space is crammed with tiny chairs. There is very little space to put your things and relax. Food and beverage is limited and toilets are dirty. Don't even think of a shower there isn't one. Good view of the Tarmac though. Found out later that Air New Zealand Business Class passengers can use the United lounge this would have been helpful to know before heading to the Eva lounge. Wished I had avoided this lounge.,1,-1.798894906
John Kneijber,Comfortable lounge with plenty of seating and partial views of the tarmac and runways. Good snacks and food on offer and great selection of drinks. Better than their flagship lounge in Auckland.,4,0.550519389
R Scott,This lounge is a nightmare. It is leased by Air NZ and they apparently have no options but one is better off not to even go in. The food selection - none. The wine selection ditto. No showers. It is tiny and cramped and unappealing. When we were called for our flight and saw what was on offer in the terminal we wished we had just stayed there.,2,-1.015756808
N Lancaster,Originally attractive but now tired and shabby - carpets furniture fabric look like pub furniture in need of replacement. Food better than previous experience. Flight indicator board useless - our flight was  minutes late but this never showed. Staff were also unaware of the delay even though the airline had phoned me. Time for a major upgrade.,3,-0.232618709
J Kneijber,We really liked this lounge. Arrived about pm on a Monday night and initially there was plenty of room. It got busier later but it still had a nice ambience. Plenty of refreshments and snacks. One of the airlines better lounges and streets ahead of Auckland International lounge.,4,0.550519389
Pierre Lebellegard,It is difficult to imagine this is a business lounge. Poor food & drink choice and press/magazine nearly absent. Definitely I won't recommend this lounge. I am a frequent flyer (Flying Blue Platinum for life). It is one of the worst lounges (maybe the worst) lounges I have experienced.,2,-1.015756808
A McNicol,Qantas outsource the lounge in Noumea to Air Caledonie. Lounge a bit on the small side for two aircraft at once but very comfortable good runway views excellent food and drink selection and the one staff member very welcoming. All in all a good offering and a nice change from the standard Qantas Club. The only downside is toilet/bathroom is outside the actual lounge.,4,0.550519389
Chris Ford,Spent  hours there on a Tuesday afternoon and was a pleasant overall experience. It's a good size and divided into several areas with a good variety of seating cell phone-free zone and kids play area. Food selection with a couple of hot choices and the usual cold fare. Trays of fresh baked cookies was a pleasant distraction. The beers and wines were above average. Customer service at the flight desk was friendly and prompt. My only gripe was the slow pace of table cleaning.,4,0.550519389
M Pratten,A Friday night at LAX it was awful lounge over crowded  Air NZ flights and A Virgin all departing within an hour no seats and screaming babies. If you pay to fly Business entry to the lounge should be automatic not on a first come basis.,2,-1.015756808
R Forey,Used this lounge for a Virgin flight and whilst not a bad lounge it's not a great one either and is certainly no Virgin Clubhouse experience. Decent selection of wines and self serve snacks but other than that the options pretty much amount to sitting and looking out of the window. There's just nothing inspiring about it - that said it's certainly more pleasant than the rest of LAX terminal areas.,3,-0.232618709
Derek Greenaway,Quite a comfortable lounge while not very exciting. Good selection of NZ wines cold meats cheese biscuits and bread with salad all self service. Several work stations with a rather slow internet connection. Staff polite and helpful. One grudge is the seating arrangements all of the side window tables are set for four people they always seem to be occupied by just one person who takes over the whole space confining the rest of the passengers to squeeze into the area in the centre. Not the best but certainly much better than having to use the dreadful facilities (or lack of them ) in LA airport,3,-0.232618709
J Cobcroft,Lost a bit of sparkle over the last visit. Seems like every airline on the planet has use of this lounge. Drab and uninviting. Good drink selection. Food very average. Koru membership comes up for renewal soon-I won't be renewing.,3,-0.232618709
J Cobcroft,Lots of changes since last visit. Most changes not good. Overcrowded and uninviting. No views of airport at all. All windows frosted!. Never again. Will not be renewing Koru membership.,3,-0.232618709
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Etihad are one of a long list of airlines which use this lounge. Inside it was clear that this lounge was in need of an overhaul. The furniture was tired and a bit grubby. Food on offer was pretty poor by Air New Zealand standards and replenishment was sluggish at best. A good selection of beverages and alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. The lounge has good views across the airport and good internet and wi-fi facilities. Showers nice and the attendants in the toilets and showers were better than in the catering side of the lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Taynton,I had not used this lounge for a number of years. The lounge is quite large with good seating - it was late at night so there were few passengers. The drink selection was good but the food was pretty bad only some tired cheese and ham on display.,4,0.550519389
David Bielli,It's looking tired colors that are drab but it has nice view of the runways okay food offering - very simple but better than many other airlines. It has good drink selection and lots of seats. I have used this lounge many times over the past  years and it's starting to look more and more tired. I also noticed that when flying United to LAX we had to use this lounge. When I switched the alliance about  years ago I started flying Delta and they also use this lounge so do some other airlines. As a consequence it can get rather busy at times and packed. The beauty about Sydney airport is that you might want to venture outside of the lounge and find equally good seating in many restaurants browse shops etc.,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Williams,"The first impression of this lounge is that all the colour has been sucked out of the room. The ""colour"" palette is of dull mud brown gum-leaf grey and khaki. To add to the disappointment is that the windows are frosted over - no view. A better view is available in the public areas. The food is very basic simple presentation. Think of simple home cooking rather than restaurant quality. Even though New Zealand produces some excellent wines (and a decent selection available) they did nothing to present these in any way to encourage you to drink them or provide information about them. The bottles where just sitting in the fridge along with beers and soft drinks. The bathroom did not appear to have been updated in the past decade and it was not serviced frequently as there were no hand towels available - empty dispensers. Nothing was presented as a premium lounge of an international airline.",3,-0.232618709
Barry Bourke,Air NZ can be a fickle airline - great today awful tomorrow. Its all about staff. The lounges are old and tired and the food selection has really gone downhill. No (or hardly any) reading material. Staff can make a difference. Empty food spots at the food counter due to slack staff - and they are very slow to keep the lounge clean and tidy.,3,-0.232618709
Peter Luffman,A spacious comfortable environment friendly staff excellent food and drink plenty of space and seating was plentiful.,5,1.333657488
Anthony Gibbons,The new lounge is superb with excellent staff service. DÃ©cor is fresh and modern. Food and beverages fine but the best bit is the shower facilities now available at Raro (good if you've just come in from an inter-island flight or are in transit to LAX ).,5,1.333657488
F Watt,Although inconveniently located in the basement of the Melbourne International Terminal and not easy to find on your first visit this lounge is surprisingly comfortable and peaceful. The food is acceptable and there is a good choice of drinks. Staff friendly toilet facilities are excellent. All in all not too a bad place to wait.,4,0.550519389
Pauline Stones,"We visited the Lounge flying from Brisbane to London and only wanted a cup of tea and a biscuit as we had been served a light meal on the flight from Brisbane. As there were no biscuits on display I asked a senior member of catering staff if I could have a biscuit only to be told that they were serving dinner and I would have to wait until . when the biscuits would be put out. When I questioned this I was told ""If I give you one everyone will want one"". Not the sort of service we would expect (or have previously received) from Air New Zealand.",3,-0.232618709
Mike Williamson,Dated disinterested staff dirty crockery on several tables. Very poor selection of tired looking and unappetising food.,2,-1.015756808
B Burney,Space is quite tight in this lounge but if you are early enough you can get a seat. There should be a few more tables for those who prefer not to eat from their knees/laps. Welcome varies according to who is on reception. The range of drinks is great showers wonderful computer/internet access. Food is not great. Cold cuts and rolls. Hot offerings appear very late (within  minutes of boarding) and are dreadful. Soup is fine. Good range of snacks (chips nuts cookies). There is a big problem however with children - they run around unsupervised often using the pseudo-marble floors as a skating track (and this has happened the three times this year I've been in the lounge). There is no child-free area. They are also given unfettered access to the computers resulting in loud and raucous behaviour. Primarily it is their parents' responsibility but Air NZ should provide areas free from this noise and behaviour for those looking for a different experience.,4,0.550519389
P Feely,Our flight left at pm the lounge was a zoo with no seating available. Staff were surly and unhelpful - we didn't try the food it looked unappetising. It was more comfortable outside in the general waiting area.,1,-1.798894906
Kevin McAfee,Excellent lounge from comfort to selection of food and beverages complimented by attentive staff. Different relaxation areas for different customers and area where kids are forbidden ensuring every traveller gets that opportunity to relax before the flight! Nice touch! It would be compliment the flight if the same wines in the lounge were served onboard international flights.,5,1.333657488
B Anderson,Clean tidy and well stocked for the small airport that it is. Plenty of space to relax and is not just one big open plan room giving the feeling of more privacy. Would happily pay to use this lounge although Napier is so efficient you never need to be there for long. Great for the business traveller. Only wish Auckland ANZ lounge could be half as nice.,4,0.550519389
Eric Rose,This is the worst business class lounge I have ever encountered - difficult to find a seat tables piled high with dirty crockery and glasses - took more than an hour to be cleared. The food on a tiny counter was limited to stir fry or pasta in cardboard cups both of which were unpleasant - no Sandwiches savouries or salad options. If it weren't such along walk from the min terminal we would have returned there and paid for our food and drink. Business Class passengers deserve better than this.,2,-1.015756808
Brian Noad,I found this lounge very dirty with cups plates and spoons lying around the tables not collected by service staff. It was a Business Lounge being used by Thai Airways First Class passengers. In the internet room there was a major disagreement between two passengers. One of whom was talking loudly on his mobile phone making it impossible for the other internet users to concentrate. This matter was report to the lounges' front desk but they seemed to ignore the complaint.,2,-1.015756808
Jim Willsher,We spent a couple of hours in the lounge yesterday and couldn't really fault it. OuR flight was departing around  to LAX. There was plenty of food and drink plenty of seating wifi worked fine the back massage was excellent. Yes some of the furniture looked tired.,4,0.550519389
J Tejada,"Extremely dated and tired furniture messy and crowded. It's supposedly the Business Class Lounge but Premium EY passengers can use it too. Great for them but diminishes the exclusivity that Business Class should get considering the premium price tag. Arrived at the lounge at .pm for our .pm flight hoping to have a light meal so we could go straight to sleep once on the plane. Found staff clearing the ""trucker cafe""-buffet-style food table because ""dinner was finished."" Great. The only food available was picked-through cheese and crackers muffins (?!) and biscuits. Asked service staff for even a cup of hot soup but nope sorry not available. The coffee bar was closed as well and the only coffee/tea available was self-serve brewed. This despite the fact that there were so many people lounging around waiting for their flights - so much so that it was difficult to find any place to sit with any silence or privacy. Any free space on the sofas and tables were littered with crumbs used plates cups and glasses. Some staff were around clearing things away but hardly enough to cope with the number of passengers there. Very disappointing. Finally found a quiet spot to settle it near the back and decided to partake of the ""free massage"" for long-haul Business passengers. Approached the table presented boarding pass and was told sorry massage room was closing for the night. Quite a number of long-haul ANZ flights leave at night - including flights going to LON and LAX which have the highest fares. Why doesn't the lounge operating hours reflect this and have extended food/service hours to cater to these premium passengers? Considering this is Air New Zealand's main hub we thought the lounge here would be impressive which is why we came for our flight early.",1,-1.798894906
A Lam,Tired looking lounge with dated decor. Staff pleasant and professional. Limited selection of food & beverages. Washrooms provide very basic facilities and need updating. Screen for flights info only at entrance,,
Stephen Sweet,"I recently joined the Alaska Air Boardroom after receiving a discount as an Alaska Gold member. I was quite impressed overall. The service was outstanding! The women working at the front desk were professional and went beyond their job to assist everyone who came in. Their smiles went along way for the numerous harried travelers. I think that Alaska could use a larger lounge area though - it felt a tad small but I am not complaining, I was glad to relax there. Fine service, great coffee and fun folks to talk to, what more can you want?",6,2.116795586
S Koenig,I was flying first class from SEA to LAX. Alaska is one of the U.S. carriers (maybe the only one) to grant lounge access to those flying first class domestically and not connecting to an international flight. Lounge was large (didn't realize at first there was a second floor). Selection of drinks and snacks was standard. Wi-Fi access was fine. Lounge was crowded on a weekday morning but I had no trouble finding a place to sit and plug in my PC or phone. I don't know if there were showers.,4,0.550519389
J Livingstone,Flying Alaska Airlines from LAX to Vancouver Canada. Lounge in LAX was fine with quiet areas good selection of food to nibble on and nice bar offerings. Even better in Vancouver where hot soup beef stew wild rice and a wide variety of sandwiches and cookies were available. Nice area for self- service wine and other drinks. Very attractive display of food and beverages. Free wifi in both lounges.,5,1.333657488
J Gardner,Refurbished but with odd furnishings. Better than waiting at the gate. This location was recently refurbished. The lounge is the same size and layout the changes are largely cosmetic (mostly new furnishings). The tables/chairs in the center area are like patio furnishings - very narrow and extremely uncomfortable chairs. The chairs along the outer wall/windows are so low to the ground that it's like sitting in child's furniture - again very uncomfortable. In the morning food covers a wide range (fruit muffins coffee cake and even a machine that makes pancakes!). In the afternoon things like cheese and crackers. A limited range of complementary alcoholic beverages and some really good microbrews. Starbucks coffee. The bathrooms while small are clean and well-stocked. Nice view out the windows of the alleyway between the C and D concourses.,4,0.550519389
H Kang,It is an up-to-date low key relaxing yet highly functionally business lounge with a large flat screen TV modern and comfortable dark color business tone sofas & tables food and beverage bar a clean restroom with hand lotion and half and full body mirrors  clocks of world time pc stations a laser printer a COPYING machine and a killer view for airplane and sunset. Staff on duty are experienced with people professional and skillful finding out what Loungers like me with a point and shoot camera are up to - taking photos of its remedies and breath taking sunset. They made me a single female Asia feel welcomed. Thanks them for making my st Board Room experience a positive one.,5,1.333657488
K Araoye,Very disappointed spent Â£. for two tickets to this airport lounge. Food and wine poor. Toilet area and shower room dirty. Not worthy of the money paid. Such a let down to start of our long journey.,1,-1.798894906
R Gibson,"We were booked into a United BusinessFirst cabin so we were given access to the Alitalia lounge located in the lower level (read as basement) of the terminal. The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (: a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad. United should be ashamed that this is what they offer their ""premium"" passengers.",2,-1.015756808
K Asher,I'm writing from the lounge. What an absolute rip-off. I paid  Euros for the use of the lounge. It is loud and crowded the food is cold and with very poor selection. The wine was poured in a plastic glass and was the tiniest quantity. There's lots of staff but they don't seem to care about much. The wifi does not work.,2,-1.015756808
Yau Siew,The Alitalia lounges at FCO are the worst I've experienced for any major airline. They're appalling. The selection of food is so dismal that I don't know why Alitalia even bothers putting anything at all out there. Unfortunately if you travel through FCO these wretched Alitalia lounges are what you get stuck with.,2,-1.015756808
Yau Siew,The worst lounge I visited compared to Hong Kong Toronto Singapore Beijing San Francisco Bangkok that I have been. No windows no food available (time AM) only a drinks bar no windows male washroom had only two toilets (no urinals so you have to wait for a simple pee). Most disappointing was after an  hour flight I love to have a shower to refresh myself but they ran out of shower kits (no towels no soap no shampoo). Never go this lounge. I cannot imagine that Alitalia's lounge in Rome is such poor quality.,2,-1.015756808
C Wajsberg,Never visited such a poor lounge before. Firstly no daylight as no windows in this lounge. Beside freshly made Italian coffee served by a friendly barman who has a little plate with some change to have every visitor understand what he wishes to receive this lounge has the smallest choice of food. Food choice goes from sweet Italian croissant to greasy couscous. Some other small pieces of bread are available but not worth to be mentioned. There is one toilet in male lavatory and this one toilet is dirty as are  showers of which two where mot working. Seating not bad and wifi works well but do not come to this lounge hungry.,3,-0.232618709
E Agamennone,Lounge was just fine: clean and conveniently located but overcrowded. Food and beverage was not you would expect from a business lounge in Italy: a few cold sandwiches basic soft drinks and house wine. Overall an average/below average lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Charles Taylor,Alitalia lounge very much outdated as are the unfriendly staff. Quality of the refreshments and selection of such is poor. The lounge is on the inside of the terminal and has no windows it is like a maze and appears to have no predetermined structure.,2,-1.015756808

C Wolfhugel,This lounge (accessible to other Skyteam travellers) is probably one of the worst I've seen in Europe. Colors are awful comfort is quite limited and facilities are just ridiculous - drinks server in a plastic cup with a very limited choice (Diet sodas not available!) nearly nothing in terms of food and you wonder what the barmaid just does there so she looks bored.,2,-1.015756808

Sanjaya Widanapathirana,FCO to LHR in Business class. I was introduced to a small shabby crowded lounge which had no windows. The lounge was very uncomfortable so uncomfortable that I left after a while and went into the Departure area. The Catering in the lounge is not bad but there is a lot of room for improvement and there are no cleaning staff in sight.,2,-1.015756808
Hilarion Martinez,One of the nicest lounges I have visited. The seating is excellent and plenty of room to find your own quiet space. The food and beverage selection is excellent. The area is clean and the location of the lounge is near the departure gate. Wifi connectivity is free and excellent.,6,2.116795586
Jezrel Sabaduquia,"Flagship Lounge at LAX was good. Showers clean and well-stocked. They also had a nice little th of July spread with cake, special red, white and blue beverages. As for lunch, chicken barbecue, mixed vegetables including corn on the cob was served. Quality was poor and the chicken was very dry. Beverage selection was not as extensive as the Flagship Lounge at JFK. Lounge itself was spacious with excellent views of the apron. Overall, a decent flagship lounge, somewhat comparable to their Flagship Lounge at JFK although catering still needs improvement.",6,2.116795586
Leonor Fraga,"This is by far  the best VIP Admiral Club we've ever been to. The ladies staff are very professional and efficient. The breakfast choices were First Class (best ever seen in an Admiral Club and we've been all over!).  We wish there would be a similar Lounge, with staff and culinary offer in the US - sadly there isn't.",6,2.116795586
J Sabaduquia,"Concourse B Admirals Club at JFK was great. Plenty of open seating, great views of the tarmac and not crowded at all. Bathrooms were well stocked and clean. Service was excellent and personable. Like most US lounges, complimentary food is poor, but  it's a space where you can work, relax and be away from the main crowd. I also tried the Concourse C lounge which was smaller but cozier. Lounge in Boston was much better in my opinion. Great views, better service and showers were lovely. It was spacious, filled with amenities. I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the  bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent. Understand that the complimentary food is abysmal but it's a great place to relax and unwind. The service in both lounges was excellent.",6,2.116795586
J Rose,Used this lounge as the BA lounge for a flight form MIA-LHR. Absolutely one of the poorest quality first/business lounges imaginable. Shabby old interior badly in need of a refresh unappetizing food choices of sad looking sandwich meats cheeses vegetables et all presented in old school trays/tins. Old school tech as well with half the power ports not functional. Not even remotely close to QF CX BA standard and BA should be ashamed to use it. With all of their traffic in and out of Miami time for a new lounge with modern interior and amenities. Appalling OneWorld Emerald prOduct that is truly substandard.,2,-1.015756808

R Schack,"Good news: Spacious. Bad news: Everything else. Have found that the airlines in the US have totally lost their way. The lounges were originally a treat that has been allowed to go downhill as passengers are gradually reduced to the status of ""living freight."" Cheap food can buy some cooked food at outrageous prices no TVs in most of the lounge the publications are ""gimmes"": from marketing firms. Wifi well it is wifi. If you are going to charge me give me some value for my money.",3,-0.232618709
K Vician,I fly from JFK - times a year using the AA business lounge. It is overcrowded noisy and unpleasant. The  drink vouchers are tacky. In other European or South American airports you have self service alcohol displayed wine liquor soft drinks etc. At CDG in Paris the business lounge has fabulous capuccino and espresso machines with fresh orange juice and fresh pastry. In Vienna cooked food for lunch with pastry also self service. No charge for food or drinks. Too bad that the AA lounge is pitiful in comparison. For the prices they charge it is mistifying how bad the quality and service are. it has been always bad but worst since the merger.,1,-1.798894906
M Conn,I cannot believe that AA view this sort of service as First Class. It is one of the worst lounges I have ever visited in terms of service. It is basically a reasonably comfortable waiting area with minimal facilities for the customers who have paid high fares. AA really need to get a true perspective on what is expected by those paying for First Class! I will not be travelling with AA again until there is a review of the facilities provided!,2,-1.015756808
A Wan,Used the lounge at terminal  near gate . I knew the food offering was going to be poor so bought a sandwich from the food court and took it with me to the lounge. I was offered two drink vouchers but only used one for a pint. A waiter was available to take your drink and paid for food orders which saved you going to the bar. The free food offering was as expected very poor a few carrot sticks etc and cookies. There was some fresh brew coffee and make your own coffee from a machine which I tried and wasn't bad. As I was transmitting I decided to take a shower the shower room was functional but hardly inspiring but did the job. Overall if your expectations are low this lounge does the job but don't expect a Cathay Pacific standard lounge,3,-0.232618709
E Riseman,This is not really a lounge in my experience. This is a corporate waiting room with a cash bar and makes no pretence of offering comfort or relaxation. It provides a more spacious place to wait for a plane and use WiFi. Compared to their code share partners British Airways and Cathay Pacific this is a real disappointment,3,-0.232618709
Nigel Gates,"My wife and were taking the daytime . Chicago to London Heathrow AA flight. We arrived at the airport at about . (without having any breakfast at our hotel) and checked-in without problems. We passed through security and after a long walk found our way to the Admiral's Club lounge. What a disappointment the lounge turned out to be - American Airlines clearly has much to learn from British Airways on how to run a decent lounge. There was no food available that I could see (with the exception of a few bagels very small muffins and some pretzels) unless you paid for it. Furthermore there were no plates available - my wife had to ask for one and had to wait for almost ten minutes before it arrived. Just what does American Airlines think their business and first class passengers are paying thousand of pounds/dollars for? This practice of making passengers pay for food in the lounge is just cheap On entry to the lounge we were each given two vouchers for free bar drinks (how many people want bar drinks at that time in the morning?) from ""the pit"" - not high quality brands of alcohol. The lounge seats were comfortable enough but there were far too many dirty glasses and plates left on tables waiting to be collected and taken away. All in all our Chicago O'Hare Admiral's Club experience was very disappointing indeed. the service we received on our eight-hour flight to the UK was also very poor and the inflight food was absolutely terrible. It will be a very long time before we fly American Airlines business class again - we will ensure all our trans-Atlantic travel is with British Airways.",1,-1.798894906
Jeffrey Kingston,This is a very pleasant lounge. The layout is spacious. Furniture is lovely. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast food is above average - bagels and a toaster,,
Andrew McBride,Flagship lounge in JFK. Really feeling tired now for what is supposed to be one of AA's best lounge worldwide. Falls short of most top tier European or Asian airlines business offerings much less first class. Decent range of drinks but nothing special in terms of quality wines spirits. Basic food options one hot one cold plus snacks cheese. Good views across to Manhattan. Small and a bit cramped though chair arms worn through to the stuffing seating close spaced so no privacy. Decor dull universally brown. Poor selection of magazines newspapers. Just doesn't feel specie. AA is improving its on board products (new business class configuration is good) but the lounge has a way to go to get to BA Cathay etc. levels.,2,-1.015756808
L Buckley,This is the Admirals Club in concourse G - American Eagle flights connect through G although all fliers can access this lounge when travelling from O'Hare. This lounge was recently updated and expanded and that is a good thing as the lounge was previously under equipped and over crowded. Expanded toilet facilities quiet area plenty of work space and well lighted. Receptionists friendly and helpful free basic booze but you pay for premium unless given cheesy vouchers why they don't just say show your international business/first class boarding pass for premium liquor is beyond me. All in all a nice environment.,4,0.550519389
G Weimann,"It's a comfortable lounge yet on the smaller size. Used it on several evening flights back to Europe. Though it serves as First Class/*Gold lounge for Lufthansa too and can also be visited by Oneworld Emerald/BA First Class passengers I never found it crowded in the evening. There is an open bar and a small buffet serving a good but limited number of cold and hot snacks. The only downgrade is the view into the terminal only. The way from the lounge to the European gates is quite long especially since the airport closed the ""shortcut"" through the duty free area. So be sure you leave the lounge in time.",4,0.550519389

F Inocentes,My sister & her son were travelling on first class tickets from LAX to Seoul Korea. They had a lay over in Dallas Texas & wanted to wait in the AA Airline Lounge but were refused entry because their tickets were purchased with frequent flier miles.

P O'Connor,Came in here in transit to Mexico after AA flight from London. Reasonably comfortable place with good views over airport. What seems somewhat mean and petty is that on checking in to the lounge you are given a voucher for just one alcoholic beverage. From a European perspective this is strange - especially since at AA Admirals Lounge in Heathrow there's an open bar. Most customers in this situation in my experience do not come into these lounges to drink the bar dry - but the option of a second drink without paying more would be nice - especially after buying an expensive business class ticket. On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy. It's a pity AA do this - as their service from LHR to DFW is a great business class product in the air in the new  ER - probably best transatlantic.,4,0.550519389
L Bogaert,This is one of the many places in the US Europeans just can't understand. Probably the worst lounge ever. It's more a waiting zone. No class. No style. No fun. No feel good. No relax. No nothing. Tip: get an Amex and go to their lounge near D.,1,-1.798894906
S Pereira,Last Sunday I walked into the Admirals Club at Heathrow Airport and walked out in a few seconds. It has the decor of a greyhound bus station from the 's.

H Rowe,"Thankfully on my return flight home that had a long layover at JFK I was able to use the AA lounge instead of the horrid BA lounge. There are actually  AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase. For that I might as well step out into the airport and buy the food of my choice.",4,0.550519389
S Koenig,"Large lounge with excellent array of facilities (including showers) and both WiFi service and several PCs (though on this visit the PCs were not working-- connection issues). You get coupons for a free ""premium"" drink. Food for sale is pretty much what you'd expect from an airport lounge (it's more a bar than a restaurant). The biggest downside is that the airport's main lounge can get crowded and finding a place to sit can be difficult at peak times (made worse by people using seats for their coats and carry-on bags).",4,0.550519389
Frank Druse,American Express has made a smart decision by opening their own lounges and making sure that the customers come first. Today I had a massage and then amazing dinner. Thank you to American Express for caring about their members.,6,2.116795586
S Mackinnon,I can't imagine any Admirals actually wanting to join this club. I've been in every one they have in the DFW terminals and none of them distinguish themselves. If you're looking for a quiet place to work this might be a good place though you can find similar places for free throughout the rest of the terminals. If you're looking for food or drinks the AC has possibly the worst food I've had in an airport - and you have to pay for the privilege. Whoever runs these places would do well to visit any of their competitors lounges it would take less than  minutes to see how far short they fall. I travel a lot and was reasonably excited to get be able to use the AC regularly - at this point I now avoid flying American when I can so that I can get status into one of the other lounges - AA doesn't make anything about being elite worthwhile other than getting on first.,2,-1.015756808
Ralph Dodd,Lounge design is dated tired and unimaginative. When I visited overcrowded and small. For a supposed flagship lounge it's small. Worst of all is the F&B offering. EVERYWHERE else in the world food and drinks are firstly of a much higher quality and secondly complimentary. I was given a couple of coupons for drinks but had to pay for nuts. Seriously. In short a lame offering.,3,-0.232618709
M Catchlove,I really struggled to find the lounge in the first place. Then I realised why - they are just to embarrassed by the service they offer to publicise it.  free alcoholic beverage which only - really and you do that by the humiliation of handing me a 'free drink voucher'? Is this really the executive lounge. Is this really what you get if you pay $+ for an international flight. Still I'm sure the wonderful free food will be great won't it - hang on you have to buy the food as well - really are you kidding me? I have a long haul flight where I want to sleep and not eat so eating beforehand is what I always do I have never had to pay for food in any executive lounge before. I guess it's time to avoid flying AA again and revert back to good old British Airways - well done BA you've outshone the competition at last.,2,-1.015756808
J Katnic,Purchased a day pass to use at DFW/ORD/LAX. This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out / of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.,2,-1.015756808

B Wijesinghe,I was at the AA Flagship Lounge on Wednesday April  between : pm and : pm. They stayed open an hour later than usual and my flight was delayed by almost four hours due to a storm that disrupted all flights at ORD. The lounge staff were outstanding on a very difficult and long work day. My lounge access came as a BA Executive Club Gold member (One World Emerald). Unlike the AA Admiral's Club lounges their Flagship Lounges provide complimentary food and alcoholic beverages. The light dinner served was very good including fresh vegetables a spread of good quality finger foods soup wines liquor and many non-alcoholic beverages. Although quite crowded that day it was very comfortable with a nice layout. Restroom facilities are limited.,5,1.333657488
Russell Brooks,What a total disgrace. You have to pay for drinks and any decent food. No working showers dirty and damaged furniture. How can American operate such a 'lounge' - when you have paid nearly $ for a ticket I'm not sure how AA work out that drinks should cost extra.,2,-1.015756808
C Colaco,I fly a lot with Oneworld and have used the lounges of BA / CX / QF and others extensively. AA's Admirals club is clearly not in the same league. At first I thought that the economics of the huge domestic US market with its relatively low fares compared to Int'l long-haul might be the explanation. But then I saw that they limit access to passengers who do have a long-haul connection so that is not the reason. A very substandard product.,2,-1.015756808

P Solo,I travel frequently via London from US. In comparison to BA Air New Zealand Air Canada or other airlines Admiral Lounge has definitely room for improvement when it comes to snacks and especially entrees. There is no variety of choices but also quality and taste is not very good. Most of the time I have been there there was about  minutes wait for refills for everything. Staff is not very involved either. I would suggest management to visit BA lounge next door and compare. I am very loyal AA customer so I am sorry that I have to write this review. Thank you.,3,-0.232618709
John Adams,There was nothing that resembled a breakfast snack aside from mini muffins which were stodgy. Coffee was sort of okay.

Charles Rippon,Torn and tired seats. Coffee (burnt) and pretzels only - all food has to be ordered and paid for!

I for one am not renewing the Admirals Club membership!,3,-0.232618709
K Tunnicliffe,I have to say that although terminal  is a new efficient terminal the lounge is not! Following the same penny pinching formula of most US based airlines you are given  tokens per passenger for complimentary drinks and after that you pay through the nose for both soft and hard drinks and food (tea coffee and water were free as were a few biscuits and apples). Compared to other airlines in Europe Australasia and the Middle East this is shabby. The lounge itself is pleasant if overcrowded. Seating when you can get any is very comfortable and many visitors were enjoying the US Open Tennis on several large screens. Food and drink policy really lets this and other US airlines down.,3,-0.232618709

Although the lounge was spotless and all used dishes were removed quickly the food available was dire. The sandwiches were curling and mini pork pies looked as if they'd been there all day. The Asian selection looked to be more appetising. Very disappointing.,4,0.550519389
B Cleary,Our company switched to American this year for more nonstop service from Chicago as for the past  years we have flown Delta but were tired of the connections. Having been a loyal crown club member / sky club I had expected AA to have a better club system and amenities. Although the club is very roomy plenty of seats wifi coffee / tea and minimal snacks you have to pay for everything. Staff at the front desk accommodating everything after that very disappointing. The club is located in the centre of the terminal thus away from most of the gates that I'm assigned so it is also inconvenient. I don't even bother going into the club any more. They should take a lesson from Delta's Sky Club - free everything nice people oatmeal bagels unlimited snacks - even though Chicago is not a hub city I will let my membership lapse!,3,-0.232618709

D Kirchhoff,Horrible. Compared to the lounges of BA or Virgin the AA lounge is beneath contempt. Avoid at all cost. Bad food poor decor low ceilings and with nasty fluorescent lights.

AA has just missed the standard of excellence and clearly does not care.,3,-0.232618709
Scott Bingham,The Admirals Club is not really a first class lounge. It's only offered to first class passengers if you're traveling overseas. I was traveling first class Toronto to Chicago to San Jose - and they wouldn't let me enter. Out of curiosity I bought a  hour pass for $ to see what was so special about this lounge. One would expect an airlines flagship lounge service to be very nice. The Admiral Lounge only offers crackers and cookies and there is no self-service bar. If you want anything more you have to pay for it. The bar is tended and they only offer cheap drinks and poor quality wine and beer. You have to pay for anything that actually tastes good. From the outside the doors leading to the lounges looks like heaven awaits on the other side. Don't be fooled. Amongst other things the staff is too preoccupied with their own personal concerns talking amongst themselves - usually about some negative aspect of their job. You have to wait for them to finish their personal conversations before they'll even look at you.,2,-1.015756808
J Briggs,Sadly we were very disappointed with AA's Admirals Club lounge at Heathrow. The lighting (harsh neon striplights which cast a stark glare over the whole lounge reminiscent of a public lavatory) was horrible and as we had left home at a very early hour in the morning we were looking forward to a good breakfast like BA provide in their lounges. We found only pretzels and packaged biscuits available until some dry rolls containing awful tasting bacon were produced hours after we arrived and had checked in. Even the coffee was grotty and we didn't fancy alcohol at am. We were not impressed and our later experiences with Admiral's Club lounges at San Juan and Chicago were even worse. We shall not be travelling with American Airlines again.,2,-1.015756808
L Donahue,"I decided to purchase a day pass to the lounge in Miami International on the way to Paris. I'd avoided it in the past because it was always a bit of a hike from the gate but I wanted to get some work done before my flight. My first clue that I'd made a mistake was when the agent at baggage check-in upon seeing that I'd purchased the day pass told me I was crazy for having done so. And she was right. It took nearly  minutes of standing at the counter in the Club to get my WiFi password and free drink voucher processed. That was disheartening but not as much as using the free drink voucher for a glass of champagne and being handed a twist off mini-bottle of sparkling wine. As you might expect it tasted terrible. The ""free nibbles"" that were provided were scarce and stale. And unlike at CDG nobody came to get me to tell my that my flight was boarding. There wasn't a single announcement made. So with  minutes to go before my flight I made the hike back to the gate and found that everyone had already boarded. This was a huge waste of my money and when I wrote to complain about it nobody offered a refund. Very disappointing.",2,-1.015756808

Jim Pappas,Have spent many a times in the Admirals Lounge in LAX terminal  and have been disappointed every time. No free WIFI provided and when you ask for a complimentary WIFI card that other Admirals lounge give out free here they do not provide them and tell you must pay. Seating is not not that plentiful or fantastic either. The complimentary food on offer are small muffins pretzels and apples which coffee orange or cranberry juice. Drinks must be purchased but they do give you  drink vouchers which is  extra to what you get at other Admirals Lounge in other airports. Very disappointing and don't even compare to other airline lounges like Qantas Club or other Oneworld lounges.,2,-1.015756808
M Bjerke,AMEX Platinum cardholders are supposed to have access to Admirals Club lounges. However when you enter the American Airlines Admiral's Club with your Platinum Card they make you feel like a second class citizen. They don't allow you to use the Wifi. In fact they segregate Platinum Cardholders in a lesser section of the lounge. Shame on American Airlines and shame on AMEX for allowing their platinum cardholders to be treated in this way.,2,-1.015756808
Jonathon Marshall,Agree with previous reviewer that this is not what most people would know as a business class lounge. It is basically just a lounge. You get a voucher for one drink and a scratchcard for wifi - utterly bizarre. The snacks that were complimentary consisted of apples and some pretzels - everything else you had to buy. Would have been better off going to Starbucks outside the lounge - don't bother!,2,-1.015756808

Erwin Elias,"I used the facilities of the lounge on my transit from Chicago to Jakarta. I had to pay in JPY of USD equivalent since I was flying economy class. They only receive cash payment. It is quite expensive to my finding, but worth the money spent. The lounge is quite big and very clean. It comprised of two main halls. The first hall near the entrance is quite packed. The first hall offers both sofa and bar seating for lone traveler. However I found the bar seats are quite tight. There are power outlets at every seat. Food served at buffet station are quite limited, yet we can order a decent options of freshly prepared Japanese food at the noodle station. There are a wide variety of drinks available (spirits, including varieties of Japanese sake, coffee, and soda dispenser). I favor the coffee a lot. If you like reading, there are a wide variety of Japanese and international newspapers and magazines available. I found that the toilet and shower rooms are very convenient and clean. Luxurious amenities are provided to ensure you are pampered and refreshed for your next flight. If you decide to take a shower, be cautious about the timing as the queue is quite long. The attendant gave me a remote caller to notify me my turn. This lounge is very recommendable for long haul travelers to freshen up.",6,2.116795586
Steve Messenbird,"This is the first time I have travelled Business class with AA so after a great experience in the lounge at Heathrow I was expecting great things when departing from Dallas. But oh how wrong I was. Firstly I was directed to the wrong lounge by the pleasant lady at check in. She sent me to the BA lounge. Anyway once I found the Admirals Club I was greeted by the most miserable man on the planet. ""do you want wireless?"" I was asked to which I was presented with a plastic card with a scratch off back. I was also presented with a ""good for one complimentary beverage"" voucher! One drink? For the amount I paid for this ticket I would expect more than one free drink. I have never seen that in a Business Class lounge before. Anyway feeling hungry I looked through the menu and decided on a panini. $.. No please Hello Or thank you from the man behind the bar just a ""sign here"". ( he didn't even take my voucher so I guess I may get another free drink after all). Food arrived fast as the bar staff cook it themselves. It's a bit like starbucks!! But it took someone an hour to clear the empty plate from my table. Taste wise? I should have eaten outside the lounge. Absolute rubbish food. Bought a second beer. Cost me $ dollars. To be honest it's a bit like sitting in a pub chain not a Business Class lounge. I think I may stick to BA next time although this is a shared flight. Forget the wifi. It takes ages to type in a  digit code. Do what others do AA. This is not Business Class as I know it. I'm very disappointed.",2,-1.015756808
J Ashworth,The amenities are nice well laid-out and may have been recently renovated. However when it comes to food this lounge falls flat on its face. As others have said they have apples a pretzel mix and some cookies for free. Also it does appear there is a coffee machine of sorts which is free. There is a list of free alcoholic beverages (cocktails beer and wine) on the posted menu at the bar. The bar attendant made no effort to interact any more than the minimum and handles all food money buttons etc. without consideration for sanitation.,4,0.550519389

G Brambilla,I visited this lounge on  May on my way to Tokyo Haneda. Very nice lounge with nice view and plenty of light. Comfy chairs and plenty of power sockets. Packs left from previous customers were not clean up meaning that some desks had considerable amount of dirty glasses snack packs etc. Very good internet connection reasonably fast and reliable. Small selection of drinks. No food whatsoever only small snacks. Similar to American lounges not European or Asian ones.,4,0.550519389
P Andersson,It was the most over rated Lounge I have visited - not even up to a basic acceptable standard. Everything was shining in glass black and chrome but the food was old and even the fruit unfresh. The staff was tired and the only one that was actually doing something was a cleaner that hoovered the floor,2,-1.015756808
Liam Buckley,This is the new first class Flagship Lounge recently opened - the previous one was a bit small but did have a nice clubby feel about it as did the Admirals Club. These new clubs have more of a hospital waiting room atmosphere about them - Flagship lounge is slightly better but not by much. Obviously the same design theme (hospital waiting room) was chosen by the designer. Slightly better selection of snacks and drinks than the Admirals but compared to BA Cathay etc it falls short. Staff welcoming and friendly lounge clean and bathrooms were also.,3,-0.232618709
Trish Benner,I have about million miles on American and transit through London a lot. I suffered though the interminable renovation at the Admirals Club at LHR and what a massive disappointment it is. It has all the charm of a bus terminal or hospital waiting area. Overly bright the seating is all out in the open so the sense is of an uninviting space that seems designed to set you on edge rather than relax you. The food offering is dreadful - little plastic wrapped awful cakes cheap wine and reconstituted juices. The staff are rude and officious. One only has to compare this with the BA lounges in Terminal  to see where they have gone wrong at every turn. This and the fact that they have now substituted the slow cramped  for wider bodied planes on a lot of the London flights just screams this is an airline who couldn't care less about its customers even those who are its premium ones.,2,-1.015756808
S Siauw,Neat and superb. They even have free printing service high-tech and hygienic shower booths. Food can be improved but compared to other Star Alliance lounge like old Silver Kris at LHR terminal  and United Club this ANA lounge is much better.,5,1.333657488
J Monte,Far superior to any lounge of US carriers at either Narita or Haneda. A wide variety of food offerings allowing one to have a complete meal before boarding. A bit crowded at times but the staff are helpful and courteous.,5,1.333657488
Jeff Plescia,This is the most sterile boring uncomfortable lounge I have ever been in. Who ever designed this monstrosity should be forced to spend some time there. The Admiral's Club more appropriately would be the Seaman's Club is just as bad. The old decor was typically British and very nice.,2,-1.015756808
Liam Buckley,"This is the new AA lounge at LHR - recently refurbished and what a disappointment. Like a hospital waiting room from a bad TV set. Uncomfortable seating in a horribly lit open area - florescent lighting is harsh - AA got it % wrong with this remodelling. This lounge holds at least  people and the mens room has  toilets! You need to manually turn on the water to wash your hands manually flush the toilet and exit via a grab handle door - like something from the 's. Having been a member of One world for  years now I would have thought AA would have learned from BA/Cathay what an international lounge should be. Very limited selection of breakfast items (tiny muffins and tiny fruit salads). Only upside was plenty of PC access - I am stunned at how wide of he mark this ""upgrade to our facility"" is. Shocking.",2,-1.015756808
Joel Richter,The Main lounge of American Airlines located between concourse H and K is well appointed staff friendly. Presented with one drink voucher each. The club was the same as it had been in  when I use to frequent it. We found a place to hook up our laptops (we had to pay  USD each to hook up to the internet) drinks were expensive. We didn't eat any food the club was busy with kids running around.,3,-0.232618709
Gunju Choi,It was great with all the new stylish shower room and the catering. I loved the food as well as the shower room. The only thing to improve on would be WIFI where I had to work.,4,0.550519389
Philip Rubenstein,Excellent wifi helpful staff large spacious decent F&B selection. One of the better star alliance international lounges and it certainly is superior to lounges outside Asia.,4,0.550519389
F Wong,What an excellent lounge at their home base spacious good service and delicious food everywhere! I was impressed by the noodle bar where you can order your choice of hot meals. Great Wi Fi quite a comfortable experience. It's recommended to spend some time to experience this lounge if you ever fly with them or on Star alliance flights.,4,0.550519389
Adrian Davis,Without doubt the worst airline lounge I have ever used. I understand the lounge has been recently refurbished but the money has been wasted. The ambience is ruined by fluorescent lighting and it feels deathly quiet - there is absolutely no atmosphere. The furniture may be new but it is neither stylish nor comfortable the tables look like coffins! The food is basic cardboard tasting shrink wrapped in plastic and only snacks. There is no hot food. Beverages are worse. There were two bottles of red wine and of white both cheap quality - not what I would expect for such a ticket. Tea and coffee are of the do it yourself variety. Staff were disinterested and rather surly.,1,-1.798894906
Vish Nadarajah,Great lounge. Difficult to get to and find it during the transit from other terminal due to Narita airport passenger traffic logistics and how the signs are marked. The lounge needs to open earlier. There are passengers always waiting from  AM  until it opens AM. Checkin tends to take too long even after you have a passport ticket and Admiral Lounge membership card! The staff is extra courteous. Nice to have a few exercise machines to warm up. The shower rooms have great privacy.,4,0.550519389
L Maher,Very crowded and when I asked staff she mentioned she would help me look for a seat. She forgot about me. Food was okay. Shower is a nice touch but could be better. No service after that and worried about my luggage. Crowded and kids - I expect a lounge to be a quiet place to work or chill out before boarding a flight. If you want to work here forget about it. They have the famous ANA curry.,3,-0.232618709
Michael Schade,One of the best lounges I have ever been to. Great food and drinks courteous and efficient staff and excellent shower facilities.,5,1.333657488
K Chen,Very slick and comfortable lounge spacious and quiet with a separate cordoned off area to rest on an armchair to soothing music and relaxing fragrance. Wide range of food choices including freshly cooked noodles on demand. Clean bathroom facilities (I did not use the shower) though there are no barriers separating the urinals. There is a separate business section with cubicles and comfortable chair and desk for you to work. Staff very courteous and friendly. The downside is there are no windows so no view of the outside and of airplanes. And the internet connectivity is poor/non-existent in certain areas of the lounge most frustratingly in the business work area!,4,0.550519389
B Coicadin,Large lounge with views over the shopping gallery below or the tarmac. Plenty of seating areas quiet corners room for families pc area with free internet access. Serviced bar with sports channel on. Drink offer limited as was the food - peanuts and carrot sticks/sauce. Poor. Given  voucher/person for alcoholic drink from serviced bar way below expectations. Sandwiches have to be paid for from the bar. Only soup available upon request (and tipping). Reading materials very limited couple of newspapers and AA brochure. Obvious cost cutting by AA.,3,-0.232618709
Bill Atkins,LAX lounge very good almost empty at am good drinks and basic breakfast foods. DFW was offered free alcoholic drink as OneWorld ticket - otherwise all to be paid for except coffee/sodas. Nice shower facilities in both lounges and staff friendly and professional. For US lounges no complaints but far from the standard of BA CX QF or JL.,3,-0.232618709
R McGraw,I purchased a -day pass for  people in my family to use the Admirals Club in Dallas-Ft. Worth Admirals Club on the way overseas. I bought it online and ask the agent if there was free sandwiches snacks and alcoholic beverages. We wanted to get a cold beer and maybe cheese/crackers. The person said all this was free and when we got there I did not find any sandwiches free or alcohol. There was some trail-mix and pretzels cokes tea and water. The menu was an elaborate price to order anything else. We did not stay long and left. Delta clubs are better with choices of drinks (alcoholic or others) finger-foods and sandwiches. Do not bother with a -day pass at Admiral Clubs the only thing you get is maybe a fairly comfortable chair.,2,-1.015756808
J Weiss,Decor is minimalist in the extreme but pleasant enough. Plenty of space and privacy with separate work areas. Hot towel and drink of your choice served. The Satellite  and Satellite  lounges are virtually identical so there is no reason to choose one over the other though the Satellite  lounge may be a little quieter. The food choices were uninspiring and not particularly extensive.,4,0.550519389
C Dickens,ANA moved operations to terminal . Ad hoc airline lounge located in the small cafe/bar next to gate area. Cafe provided free wifi access and served mediocre hot/cold snacks and alcoholic beverages. The cafe opens to the departure area and is not a lounge where one can relax work or read.,3,-0.232618709
C Friedman,We arrived LHR after  hour flight from Cape Town. We were told that there was no hot water for showers. For simple washing up the ladies room was not even stocked with towels or soap. My husband reported that the men's room was filthy. When I finally approached one of the staff for entry to the shower room for a cold shower she was less than pleased at the interruption and seemed quite put out. Seating was shabby and tired-looking. Food offering was awful. There were  computers in the lounge occupied by a couple using them for twittering and net surfing.,1,-1.798894906
Simon Taylor,Under renovation with partial completion. Standard US furnishings with reasonable atmosphere. Crowded for much of time there and other than nuts and juice everything had to be bought thus bringing down the scores. Internet access was on the blink.,3,-0.232618709
Susan Cory,"Worst international lounge I've ever been in. We're supposed to ""pardon their appearance"" due to their renovation. Why didn't they just set up card tables in the hallway? OK there were some alcoholic drinks on offer along with tasty items like cardboard muffins in plastic under the fluorescent lighting. Packed in for  hours with guys yelling into their cell phones the distant receptionists ignored all we waiting sufferers. Is it any wonder that American Airlines is having financial problems?",1,-1.798894906
Dang Pham,The Wine and Sake choice are excellent good quality. Choice of food is not extensive but okay. The lounge is very large and seating are plentiful. Showers excellent with individual amenities.,5,1.333657488
S Madan,Decent lounge. It had a good variety of food. The comfort level wasn't that great but staff were nice and welcoming. Wi-fi connection was good but there was no TV.,4,0.550519389
Brian Smith,Very large nice design good selection of drinks of all kinds (though the sake bar was not stocked properly as many bottles empty!) and a comfortable experience. The massage service is inconvenient. You cannot book ahead of time and massage attendants are busy when you try to book at the lounge when you check-in so it makes it impossible. They should get a dedicated staff in order to make it a real amenity not just a fake one. In its own right a decent lounge experience but does not compare to the JAL Sakura Lounge at Narita which is superior on all accounts.,4,0.550519389
Garth Freeman,"Have American Airlines not seen the way the rest of the world does it? What is a ""pay bar""? What is it with ordering and paying for food? After paying $ for a return business class ticket I do not expect to pay for a beer or a sandwich in the lounge waiting for a flight. As for the ""drinks vouchers"" stamped with a date - cheap and nasty! It is a real pity because the lounge itself is richly appointed. It is a warm and comforting environment spoilt by the need to pay for food and drinks.",2,-1.015756808
Liam Buckley,Having flown AA for  years the Flagship Lounge/Admirals Club experience is one of my most disappointing with AA. The typical Admirals Club is rather tired has a poor selection of food and drink and are often crowded. Internet access has become one of the main reasons I keep my membership. The Flagship lounges (I have experienced LHR/ORD/San Juan) are better but typically quite small. It is mind boggling to me that they do not have one at their hub in DFW - but even these are nowhere near the quality of BA/Cathay for st class passengers. Their shower facilities are fairly decent with Chicago being recently upgraded but again Flagship do not have these - Admirals Club only. All in all not close to international standards with some of the lounges having totally insufficient bathrooms for the capacity of the lounge (ORD G Concourse is a good example -  toilet for men in a club with a + capacity).,2,-1.015756808
J Bond,This lounge is always busy. It is a nice clean lounge in mostly good shape but starting to show some wear and tear. WiFi is great and there are lots of outlets to plug in. Seating is comfortable and it is usually quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to chill and read or do work. Don't expect to get anything decent to eat though. On my last visit (almost identical to my previous  visits this year) - which was more than  hours - the offerings consisted of one small EMPTY platter with sign that said 'Sushi' one small EMPTY hot plate with sign that said 'Chicken WIngs'. Food that was actually there consisted of a handful of pretzels with orange 'cheese' paste that tasted like wax a meagre salad bar with undercooked unseasoned flavourless potato salad and four large baskets of dry bread offered with jam and butter. About  tiny vegetable sandwiches made an appearance for  seconds - but they were immediately hoovered up by patrons desperate for anything decent to munch on. Three cups of vegetable rice also appeared briefly - but it looked and tasted like it was leftover from  weeks ago. Oh - and lest I forget two small cereal bowls with thimble sized cookies were offered for dessert. There are also cheap paper instant noodle cups always on offer. No proper bar (some beer on tap no wine to be seen no cocktails). Eat and drink before you come here.,4,0.550519389
Brian Smith,Very good lounge for the US! Large decent food with some variety decent drinks on offer too. Free wifi access shower rooms available seemed new or newly refurbished. Only complaint would be that there were not enough toilets available. A good experience and something to look forward to when going in and out of LAX - a rather bad airport.,4,0.550519389
Y Chang,Really enjoyed this lounge. Lots of room free internet use. The food selection was great. There was sandwiches sushi hot noodles lots of snacks. Very comfortable. Not very many magazines to read though.,5,1.333657488
Liza Li,The lounge was great. Lots of room seats cubicles with computer (large screens) to check emails etc. Staff were friendly and helpful. To be able to relax eat (not so great) but lots of choices and shower I'd say this is great,4,0.550519389
A Abbott,Arrived around .pm for midnight Emirates flight so was looking forward to eating a light dinner. Food and drink selection was extremely mediocre. There was a selection of overcooked tomato pasta a huge bread mountain with toaster which nobody touched. The salad bar and grilled vegetables were depleted and obviously the most popular. No dessert except some cut pineapple and sliced oranges. Pot noodles was obvious choice for Asian travellers. Compared to the business lounges in HK London and Dubai the Asiana lounge really needs to step up. At that time in evening the last thing we want is a carb overload. Suggest you cut out all the pasta and serve cold cuts salads and a decent cheese board some chocolates or dessert of some sort and not the plastic Kraft cheese on display. If we are playing business class fares then I expect half way decent food in the lounge. If I knew it was going to be this bad I would elected to eat in one of the restaurants in the airport but unfortunately everything closes at pm in Incheon Airport. On the positive side lounge was spacious wifi works and nice to have massage chairs. However can we have instructions in English as well please?,3,-0.232618709
Robert Chun,Roundtrip from HNL to ICN  experienced this lounge before returning to Hawaii. Due to security people watching the escalators was not able to lounge hop to other Star Alliance lounges located at other gates. Lounge is very large with several desktop computers available. You need a password given out at reception to access the internet. Be sure to explore both sides because they have different food available. On the right there was a chef dishing out a cold noodle dish and sandwiches. The left side featured pasta and sushi which kept running out and had to be replaced with different foods. As others have stated. the food choices are very limited and the cup noodles are very cheap looking.,3,-0.232618709
J Laforteza,"I had a chance to visit this lounge as I was flying business class with American Airlines that day. Came about : very quiet and lots of seats. They have laptops and the internet and wifi is good. There are rooms with massage chairs. Food was fine. They had a ""hot"" meal buffet at :. Noodles Fried Rice and Tofu and vegetables. Also had some fruit cold salads sandwiches and kimbap. Coffee was fine. Overall I'd go there again if I had a chance.",5,1.333657488
Y Cho,Excellent lounge. Food is pretty good and cleanliness is perfect. Since they have expanded the lounge now it's not so crowded even on peak time.,5,1.333657488
L Kopp,Overall the lounge is comfortable quiet and has showers which is very nice. If you are lucky enough you can get one of about six cubicles which have some privacy and have foot rests so you can stretch out. I was disappointed with the food however. For this trip we used biz class lounges in O'Hare Narita Bangkok and New Delhi and they all had better food especially Narita and Bangkok. I will say the comfort level in Seoul was the best of what we saw.,4,0.550519389
Peter Goldsbury,I had a six-hour stopover in Seoul Incheon and used this lounge. The seats were comfortable the lounge was never too crowded and there was an excellent choice of food. My only gripe was the washroom. It was rather small but I was able to use the one in the neighboring First class lounge. To add some perspective I was on a trip from St Petersburg to Hiroshima via Moscow and Seoul and the lounge was a welcome contrast to the Aeroflot lounge in Sheremetyevo Terrminal D.,4,0.550519389
Keith Rogers,Very good lounge for depart from Seoul to LA. Internet service very good food ok. I do note the comments on noodles - yes a tad tacky but actually like noodles so not that bad really. Lots of the chairs are more stadium - rows all facing the same direction so number of seats that are more for  people to sit together is a lot less. Still overall not a bad lounge in a stellar airport. And yes Japan and Korea have the best toilets ever.,4,0.550519389
R Wilkinson,Great lounge. Very comfortable and nicely decorated. The food was lovely and continually serviced. Coffee great. Toilets were of a high standard with an attendant. High quality toiletries and very clean. We enjoyed this lounge.,5,1.333657488
R Wilkinson,Comfortable but a bit dated. Seats comfortable. Didn't like the food set out and ended up eating toast and peanut butter. Good coffee.,4,0.550519389
W Bleeker,Extremely disappointed we were here a month ago and this place has got worse! Now they have plastic cups for wine! I suppose that is an improvement as last time we were here they had no wine! There are four types of lettuce to eat and cups of noodles tea coffee and soft drinks no beer a white wine a red and four types of spirits. I have read the previous reviews and the lounge appears to have got progressively worse. In all fairness to Asiana there is a sign up apologizing for things while they improve the lounge however I would say they have left it far too long before doing anything! As already mentioned the seating is uncomfortable and there are not many power outlets. We have flown business class with a lot of airlines and I can't fault the in air experience with Asiana however their lounge experience leaves much to be desired.,3,-0.232618709
F Wong,Business class lounge is quite spacious with lots of seats very welcoming staffs. Speedy Wi Fi. Food wise there really isn't a lot of choices it was strange to see so many cup noodles being stacked out kind of cheap to be offered cup noodles rather than proper hot meals (there was only a very few). Choices of drinks not bad quite a busy lounge at pm. All in all an average experience slightly underwhelming.,3,-0.232618709
J Min,This lounge at am was very crowded. The chairs and couches were poorly designed and showing some wear and tear but lounge well maintained and clean. Limited choice of food and salad bar fresh eggs were available. Shower was very good. Great wi-fi and plenty of computers if you do not have one. Overall not too bad but it really needs some attention on seating and food selection.,4,0.550519389
Richard Cox,The lounge was very overcrowded and struggling. Glasses and plates were left uncleared bench top tables were left uncleaned. Food and drink choices were limited and of poor quality. Frankly the lounge was unacceptable for a supposedly -star airline. Better quality seating food drink and WiFi was to be found outside of the lounge.,2,-1.015756808
H Y Kim,Nothing changed since I was start using with the lounge in . They only serve little food for their guest. Asiana need to change their lounge service. I think they need to change this better to show their inflight menu.,4,0.550519389
Anthony Sarantos,Clean and spacious with friendly staff was my experience in the Asiana Business Lounge at Incheon. Good mix of food options in a buffet style and drinks were plentiful (alcoholic beverages were perhaps a little limited but onboard wines made up for it). Nice shower rooms available to use good variety of chairs and the lighting created a relaxing atmosphere. Pleasant venue to relax in before long flights.,5,1.333657488
Christine Fitzgerald,Excellent state of the art facility to relax in before long haul flight. Lounge design was very attractive and made to look like a European library and the grand piano added a nice touch. Lighting pleasant and plenty of comfortable loungers massage chairs and relaxation rooms were offered. Food and beverages were excellent and much like those served onboard with both hot and cold options. Toilets and shower facilities were very clean and expensive bathing products were offered. Convenient locations to do some work and free wifi was also available. Staff service very pleasant.,5,1.333657488
Kalle Persson,An okay interior but some of the chairs are in substandard condition. Remember that ICN is Asiana's hub and I was expecting more. Food that was offered is not good. Two choices plus noodles. Only four choices of hard liqueur.,3,-0.232618709
K Parsonson,Asiana's Incheon First class lounge was certainly above average although I expected more considering it is their main hub. The lounge is spacious and luxurious with modern facilities. The shower rooms and toilets were pleasant and maintained well. The staff were immaculately presented and their service was exceptional. The main let down was the substandard food. Although there were still quality food and wine on offer it was nothing spectacular and the options seemed quite limited. Nonetheless the lounge is comfortable and allows for plenty of relaxation which is the main thing.,5,1.333657488
D Paik,First time to use this lounge around  pm yesterday and it was fairly crowded. It provided us more than adequate facilities. Overall above average.,4,0.550519389

C Dickens,Located on the nd level of the departure area the lounge is a windowless spacious room with a self serve bar offering beer hot/cold beverages and mediocre snacks. Private lavatory without any shower facility.,3,-0.232618709
R Rouse,Clean and tidy lounge with comfortable seating this lounge is operated by Swiss Intl Air Lines. No real choice of food except a few cakes and a pretty poor excuse of a shower. Asiana could do with using a much better lounge to compliment their great airline. The lounge is also before security!,3,-0.232618709
A Gascoyne,Mock European Manor is a little too mock but this is Korea. Friendly and attentive staff. Food for a first class lounge was mediocre. A lukewarm beef dish and a lukewarm prawn dish (these were the better dishes). Only wine was Californian Chardonnay although Moet was on offer too. Seating is comfortable massage chairs excellent and internet connection was very fast - shame seats do not have laptop power outlets. Lacking day beds. Overall compared to Swiss or Lufthansa first class lounges in FRA or ZRH this is lounge is lacking behind.,4,0.550519389
Jim Reid,This needs a real sort out. Claustrophobic in the low ceilinged area the high ceilinged area is like being in a rd rate hospital waiting area. Seats uncomfortable food average drinks range very average.,2,-1.015756808
R Gamba,Perfect lounge except for the very limited food offering. Shower rooms equipped with brand names amenities. Definitely one of the best airline lounges in Asia.,5,1.333657488
G Cassie,We transferred through Incheon. On the inward journey we spent a few hours at the lounge in terminal  - on the return the lounge in terminal . While they are both decorated and laid out similarly terminal  is newer. The shower rooms are a little nicer the layout a littler more varied and the business centre much bigger. While Seoul has a phenomenally spacious efficient and relatively pleasant airport there is more shopping in terminal  than . I compared duty free prices though and while there are savings on alcohol and tobacco many cosmetics and clothing were exactly the same as mall prices in Canada. Some of the areas Asiana could improve would be the inordinate announcement of flights,,
M Lasser,Stunning facility. It's modeled to look like a comfortable manor library with shelves of books attractive lighting and a baby grand piano! Several relaxation rooms with loungers. several more with state of the art massage chairs. A TV/DVD room with large flat panels. Catering includes Korean tea service with traditional snacks cold bar with smoked salmon and duck hot bar with lamb and lobster thermadore. I wish the inflight catering was this good!. Excellent drink selection with proper barware. Business center with three fast computers. Showers and toilets with state of the art Toto technology (a translation card here would have been helpful!).,5,1.333657488
Norman Sutherland,This lounge is about as old as the airport itself but is clean well furnished and has a perfectly good range of facilities. Food and drinks choices are fine and the staff are helpful and efficient. A quiet oasis of comfort in an otherwise terrible airport.,4,0.550519389
Robert Kmen,"Once you get past the dragon ladies at the gates, this is a fine lounge. The Austrian sparkling wine is fine, the food choices are abundant, and he windows are big, if not necessarily overlooking much movement. It should be noted that the catering service staff are both efficient and friendly.",6,2.116795586
M Pasic,"I am a frequent traveler and have an opportunity to sit in many lounges around Europe and the world. This Austrian lounge is at the bottom of my list. In fact, I don't think I will bother using it again as it offers less than the airport facilities. I was using it for an hour from - am on a Saturday. The choice of breakfast items is APPALING. Bread, jam, margarine or butter, cornflakes, muesli and apples. That was it! Not to mention that the milk was not marked as skim or full fat and there was only one pitcher of milk next to the cereals. No bananas, no yogurts, no cheese - those are the (inexpensive) basics of a lounge breakfast spread from Kathmandu to Lima airport lounges. Last week I flew through Munich and was amazed at their offering. I am so surprised that the airline of such high reputation offers such low quality of lounge services. They need to take a cue from Lufthansa!",4,0.550519389
Erez HarTal,Small Lounge. Good view of the airport but not enough seating. Good selection of drinks. Stayed there for an hour and a half. Lounge crowded. Hot eggs cheeses spreads pastries. Entrees kept being warm and replenished. Very small rest area.,4,0.550519389
L Besso,It's a small cosy lounge with good food. I really like the menu. One of the best non alcoholic beverage choice in the world. Unfortunately the lounge open quit late in the morning if you have an early flight you will face a closed door. It's a shame.,4,0.550519389
R Deu,Visited the lounge th Feb at pm. It is difficult to find it going up and down the escalator and walking through long narrow hallway. It was packed as always. People standing only  pc but busy at all times. Basic newspapers option and basic food. Nothing special and pretty much the same as the old Sen lounge in the old terminal. One would expect that with a new terminal opened last year the lounge would be bigger and better. But no. Nice country and city but the lounge has not met my expectations.,2,-1.015756808
Magnus Gustafsson,I visited the lounge in the G-area (Schengen) on August  at :-:. The lounge is nice and tidy and rather seldom overcrowded. The variety of drinks and food is good. Normally you will find both hot and cold food that is very tasteful. The seats in the lounge are not especially comfortable. The free WiFi is always troublesome and I have never managed to connect but the are free computers and Internet cables available. Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN. The volume should be adjusted to be just slightly higher since it is very difficult to hear anything if you are not sitting  metre or closer to the TV. In general I would however rate this lounge as comfortable and relaxing.,3,-0.232618709
M Mayer,A nice but too small lounge during peak hours. Warm but not very good food at lunch. Good choice of drinks and coffee and choice of newspaper. Free and fast Wifi. Only  WC at the men toilets - prepare for queuing and a not so clean experience during peak hours.,4,0.550519389
Mauricio Canosa,Nice lounge small but modern and well appointed. A nice buffet with appetizers salads soup and hot entrees which were very good. Great selection of wines and spirits.  computers but internet was unreliable and I could not open most sites. Good selection of magazines and helpful staff. To use the toilets you must go out as they are shared with Business class lounge. You have to ask the receptionist to get into First lounge as the door remains closed during all time. Private with nice views of the apron. But a very hard to find lounge. And found Wien Airport confusing with no clear signs or information staff not a friendly airport at all.,4,0.550519389
Jose Carvalho,Totally unacceptable! Old lounge at least had some charm. New lounge is worse in every aspect (besides drinks selection which is still fair). Food is a disaster. Toilets facilities a bad joke. Austrian needs urgently to improve this situation.,2,-1.015756808
A Shkaruba,Austrian business lounge in the old terminal was not the best and not spacious but it was sort of cozy and food selection was decent Austrian business lounge in the new terminal is terrible. More space there but design is awful all in cold colors and strange furniture. The food is scarce and even worse than awful.,3,-0.232618709
T Scott,After a  hour flight from Bangkok I was looking forward to a hot shower but discovered that this lounge does not have shower facilities. First time I have ever experienced this. The lounge itself gives the impression that it is very tired and outdated. Food and beverages choices are very limited. Such a disappointment after a great flight with Austrian Business Class.,3,-0.232618709
Marc Pauquet,Never seen such a bad lounge. Minimal food & beverage selection one cold soup some dry salads and lukewarm chicken dish - was scared to eat then didnâ€™t know for how long the food was in.

Seamus Conlan,"I cannot believe that this is a ""business"" lounge! It resembles the inside of an Easyjet flight with uncomfortable seats wobbly glass tables and the second to worst food and beverage selection I have ever seen in  years of business travel. There was no red wine as they had ""run out"" at . The quality of the spirits on offer appear designed to ensure that no-one drinks them: ultra low quality brands.",2,-1.015756808
Henning Schaefer,Providing plenty of space inside the lounge is a bit hard to find. Once inside there are several areas to choose from (relaxation entertainment business) with seating quality differing quite a lot between areas. Business area provides laptop ports (Power/LAN) pre- configured internet terminals Entertainment area club seats and a single TV and the relaxation area features some kind of (uncomfortable) armchairs with footrests. Moving between areas and to the lavatories requires the visitor to walk through a series of dungeon-like floors rendering the lounge layout a bit confusing. Snacks/Drinks selection average WiFi didn't work for me.,3,-0.232618709
R Ganbich,What a disappointment. Crammed full of people uncomfortable seating inferior food service and a bizarre cheap-looking bad taste dÃ©cor. Staff very friendly and plenty of them at the welcome desk but not the seating areas. Very poor sanitary rooms. I was surprised that this should be the flagship lounge of the airline's home base.,2,-1.015756808
Tim Foran,Uncomfortable and inadequate number of seats. No couches to stretch out on. No showers. Single toilet for all passengers. Certainly not at all suitable for long distance layovers. Loud and noisy. Barely more comfortable than the main part of the airport itself. Does not add to Austrian's credibility.,3,-0.232618709
M Rapp,Not the biggest lounge and it gets quite busy. Nevertheless very trendy and airy design. Stylish bar area with plenty of drinks and a small but high-quality selection of food. The Do&Co mousse au chocolat is worth a detour to this lounge! Llimited toilet facilities which force you to queue. No public PC available but wireless internet if you've got your own PC with you.,4,0.550519389
J PHILLIPS,Lounge at Vienna is reminiscent of a Costa Coffee shop at a motorway service station. Very poor selection of nibbles available and themed contemporary seating which was only comfortable for a brief visit. Washroom facilities clean but basic and very old fashioned.,3,-0.232618709
D Ruckel,I entered the lounge at  AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional,,
M Chia,After being deprived of a lounge in Santiago I was hoping to be compensated by the new lounge in Bogota. But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed  the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try  and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once. And some older people are not so mobile so they need good direction signs.,3,-0.232618709
Richard Winger,Avianca international business lounge was lovely when it came on line a couple of years ago. Tasteful decor imaginative catering reasonably comfortable. Since then it's gone sadly downhill. It is impossibly packed at peak hours food is pathetic (dusty sandwiches no plates plastic glasses no service) computers generally occupied by kids playing games the main lounge dominated by blaring TVs so work impossible. The best you can do is hug one of the little chairs in the front room and use earplugs. Another strange habit of the airline is to call US flights in the lounge while there is still a half hour line for secondary inspection at the gate.,2,-1.015756808
Uwe Bode,Nice Lounge with friendly staff divided into  areas one with view over the airfield which is good as I personally donÂ´t like places without windows. A real drawback is that they donÂ´t provide plates not even plastic plates for the snacks one has to use napkins! Strange for a Business lounge. The catering itself is not bad but nothing special either. Self-service bar unlike the real bar service at Lima airport for example. At peak hours it can be really packed especially between pm and :pm when many AV international flights leave. Nevertheless a nice place to relax after check-in and security procedure. Also not far from the gates short walk of - minutes. All in all good average.,3,-0.232618709
Nuti Damrongphatr,"The lounge has just been renovated and it looks nice. It seemed to have much more space than it actually is. Food offered included Thai snack, Bakery and pastries items, as well as soft drink, juice, tea, coffee (Alcoholic beverage is not on the list, or made known to visitors). Seating is plenty and comfortable, free wifi offer and the connection is very quick.

David Jackson,"Too busy to be an outstanding experience. Choice of snacks and cakes plus tea coffee hot chocolate and orange squash. Excellent wifi until the lounge fills up then streaming from YouTube becomes unacceptable. Very noisy and squashed since these lounges are free to use for all passengers in Economy class.""",6,2.116795586
Pascal Poppe,"If you fly economy class and you can wait in a lounge for your next flight you are lucky because not so many airlines allow economy passengers in the lounge without extra charge. This was an extraordinary experience with free WIFI and snacks like mini sandwiches cookies popcorn coffee tea and powder juice. In fact there is a choice of more than  snacks to choose from. To be fair the Bangkok airways lounge in Chang Mai is slightly better with some extra ice tea and ice coffee plus a larger selection of snacks.,4,0.5505193893044773
D Joredsson,The Blue Ribbon Lounge at Suvarnabhumi is a disaster. First thing you notice is the heat. This is the second time I have to tell the ladies working there to turn on the air condition. First thing you see is a big stain on their carpet. The service is non smile and non attentive.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Robert Barnes,Fantastic. I wish Canada and the USA would adopt your service level. We enjoyed the relaxation and the refreshments in the lounges. We travelled to Phuket Koh Chang. Siem Reap and Koh Samui and downtown Bangkok. What a treat to be in comfort at airports where the staff need to be commended for their service.,5,1.3336574878175844

D Keenan-Bokr,The Blue Ribbon Lounge is located near departure gate . We were practically the only two persons in the lounge that day. We were greeted by a staff member who immediately brought us a small menu and took our drinks order. They have a selection of cold and hot snacks which you can help yourself to or order something warm from the menu. There is a massage chair tucked away in a room and another room with a small library and armchairs.,4,0.5505193893044773
D Keenan-Bokr,Located near Gate . This is a lovely lounge painted bright blue and white. It overlooks the beautiful manicured gardens of the airport. We were greeted warmly and given a cold drink. The staff brought us a menu from which we ordered a hot meal. There is a selection of cold and warm snacks which is self service. There is free internet and the lounge has approx  computers. There are no toilets within the lounge itself but outside the lounge near Gate . They are clean and tidy and have aquariums with tropical fish incorporated into the walls. The staff kept us up to date the whole time about our flight delay and came to personally collect us when the flight was ready for boarding. A very nice experience and can recommend.,5,1.3336574878175844
N Damrongphatr,Qualified customers will be entitled to use Blue Ribbon check in counter and Blue Ribbon Lounge once a month. The lounge is in the same area as economy class lounge but properly zoned. Selection of hot food and snack. Service is less smiling more formal and professional than economy class lounge. Nice looking decoration with touch of Thai. Facility include private relaxing room massage chairs WiFi Internet terminal and shower.,4,0.5505193893044773
Alison Williams,The lounge which provides complimentary hot and cold drinks and biscuits is available to all Blue Islands passengers. This seemed to surprise a couple of them who arrived looked around and backed out again as if they thought they'd made a mistake then reappeared looking rather impressed! I would imagine the lounge would be greatly appreciated if there was a delay although I haven't yet experienced a delay with Blue Islands.,4,0.5505193893044773
Bill Atkins,The lounge can be accessed by all passengers flying with the (single class) airline. The lounge is comfortable and offers peace and quiet except during periods where two or more full flights are departing at similar times. Self service for complimentary drinks and snacks.,2,-1.0157568077217367
J Elouali,What a difference from our last visit to this lounge in April see previous review below. Lounge had only a couple of other passengers. Area and tables were spotless two pleasant staff in attendance served hot drinks by staff cakes/pastries and filled rolls on trays were covered with cling film an improvement from last visit. Newspapers magazines wi-fi TV screen was showing France . All in all a pleasant relaxing wait for our flight.,4,0.5505193893044773
M Elouali,Four staff chatting amongst themselves unwilling to help seemed like they were doing a favour rather than providing a service. No coffee available for the machine. My wife had to ask three times same request made by another passenger we waited  minutes before a junior was sent out to fetch supplies. Staff unwelcoming and unfriendly as if everything was too much trouble for them. Food on offer:- pizza bites and salami filled hard bread rolls not covered unhygienic and unappetising. Tables tops messy with uneaten food and cups/glasses from previous passengers cleared and wiped only after complaints from passengers about the mess. The junior staff member carried this task out after being shouted at by senior staff in full view of passengers. Toilet facilities: paper towel dispensers empty offered toilet paper to dry hands by the attendant.,2,-1.0157568077217367
N Werner,Flying on LX grants you access to The Great British Lounge at T for international departures. The lounge has great views of the airport and whilst visiting during breakfast had a nice and good selection of dishes available from cold to warm breakfast items. Lounge was very busy but there were still some seats available. Design is nice modern but also classic and typically British. Service was efficient but not really welcoming. The washrooms are terrible though. They looked very used and also seemed dirty. It is a good lounge and I hope that it will be kept in the future.,4,0.5505193893044773

D MacDonald,Separate lounge for Gold Card holders in Edinburgh but seems it is no longer used as last three times I have been there the main lounge has been closed and everyone is in the Gold Lounge. Selection of food and drink slipping over the last three years - just crisps biscuits cheese and crackers. Something hot during the day would be nice. Free WiFi involves logging in and providing details how hard can be it to have a dedicated WiFi with a password which is handed out to lounge members?,3,-0.23261870920862976
M Rowbotham,A long time since I used bmi and this lounge is really quite pleasant. After checking the services and facilities online at their website I must admit that it does not however live up to the claims they make. It was looking quite grubby when I visited - sitting in several different places the armchairs had crumbs and mess down the side of cushions and floor was not clean (to put it politely). Snack food okay but nothing exceptional. I guess they are measuring themselves against perhaps Lufthansa or United lounges and that is a benchmark far too low. Washrooms were okay although not much cleaner than public facilites here at terminal . Biggest disappointment was staff service - found them really quite offhand and lacking any customer skills or finesse. I see that Lufthansa is trying to get rid of bmi and that may be why the staff were so dismal and customer unfriendly?,3,-0.23261870920862976
Adam Rowland,The bmi Diamond Club & Business lounges are a retreat from the hustle of Heathrow and the dreary limited seating of Manchester. The seating in both airport lounges is ample it is not luxurious. There are places to work or relax and both MAN & LHR have great views of the apron. There is a good selection of newspapers and staff are helpful. Selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages but by no means a wide selection. Drinks are complimentary. There is a very limited food selection with pretzels and cookies the most regular options. For domestic flights from both MAN & LHR the departure gates are moments away. However on long haul bmi flights from MAN you are collected by a bmi staff member and escorted to the departure gate.,3,-0.23261870920862976

G Fedele,An update of a previous review from another customer. Three months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink. I asked at the check-in counter how is it possible that British Airways is not taking care of this issue. The person in the counter was very aggressive: 'Alitalia will not let us use their lounges - and the other lounge is already too busy'. The point is that British Airways is not taking care of the issue.,1,-1.798894906
M Hawthorn,"I wish British Airways operated lounges that were more like this third party facility. The staff here in Vienna was polite, welcoming, explained all the lounge facilities to us, and was generally interested in customer service, Sadly, that is something that British Airways has lost in the past  years. This lounge is located before Immigration and the gate security, so you need to allow - minutes to board, subject to time of day. Great range of food and beverages in the lounge, nice seating areas, and the only downside was the lack of power facilities for laptop and recharging my phone.",6,2.116795586
M Nal,"It's not really First Class. Should be advertised as Business Class. Food OK , plenty of seating, plenty of magazines, but way overcrowded when we visited. But First Class lounge? I don't think so. I tried the Turkish Airlines Business lounge in Istanbul -  that should be advertised as First . Having said that it's getting crowded in their lounge as well now.",6,2.116795586
Bob Motto,"The British Airways lounges at Terminal  in Chicago are starting to look a little dated and tired now. There are two lounges - one small First Class Lounge overlooking the tarmac and the other larger lounge opposite next to the food court. The First Class lounge is small and cramped with very little in the offering of food and drinks. It is also looking dirty too with plates and glasses taking a lot of time to be removed too. The lounge although has nice views over the tarmac did get too busy so I went across to the other Terraces Lounge. Here they offer Pre-Flight Dining, as well as seating areas and again very limited offerings of Food and Drinks. This lounge does look cleaner but feels very dark as there is no natural light again the lounge is small but soon got busy with passengers as the departure time drew nearer.",5,1.333657488
R Gonzaga,"I used this lounge as a customer with Qatar Airways. Spacious and impressive offerings of alcohol but that's about it. Food on offer in the morning was abysmal. A few dry muffins, cereal, yoghurt and sliced cold turkey. No showers to avail of. It needs a better selection of food, preferably some warm offerings. Otherwise, it was adequate.",4,0.550519389
H Kerrigan,It is disgraceful that British Airways treats its Club Europe and Executive Cub members with such disdain and contempt. Two months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink. British Airways is enticing customers to use other airlines.,1,-1.798894906
James King,"Given Heathrow is BA's home base you would expect their lounge facilities to be of good order. Unfortunately that is not the case as my recent visit (outward journey) highlighted a number of failings, notably quality of food, overcrowding and general ambiance. This lounge is in serious need of a 'makeover' and a new catering company needs to be introduced. On my inbound journey I decided not to use the lounge and chose instead the general T facilities which were of a much better standard, albeit not free.",1,-1.798894906
Michael Davies,"This lounge is shared between many airlines, airside at the International Terminal. The lounge is spacious, with a few secluded quiet areas, overlooking the airfield. A friendly barman with a full choice of complimentary beers, wines and spirits. Nice choice of soup, sandwiches, cheese, cakes etc at self service buffet, but no hot meals. The lounge staff came round with mini cheesecakes and were happy to take your order for drinks. There are showers, but I didn't use them. Relatively short walk to the departure gates.",6,2.116795586
Mark Schultz,"I'm a fairly frequent visitor to this lounge. It is very busy, and you might want to go to the lounge on the south side or the Terminal B lounge.

A good selection of magazines and speedy WiFi.",6,2.116795586
D Stead,"A little difficult to find! Turn left after security, past London News (aka WH Smith) follow signs and it is on the fourth floor although that isn't very clear. Nice lounge large and pleasantly decorated with comfortable chairs and good position for plane spotters! We arrived around pm, there was a very small but nice fresh salad bar, soup, various sandwiches, and fruit, nuts, crisps all constantly replenished, the only sweet things were biscuits next to the coffee, as we were leaving at pm it seemed hot food was being served. A good selection of wines, spirits, soft drinks, juices, tea coffee, you need to ask for Champagne and I did a lot! Staff were all very pleasant and helpful. If you require power points the only ones I could see were at the back of the lounge in the corner opposite the wines and spirits.

F Chambers,"The old BA lounge at Schipol was small, cramped, had a poor selection of food and the staff were indifferent at best and unfriendly at worst.  The new lounge has managed to retain all of those
things, with an added  minute walk through a temporary tunnel from the terminal building. The only positive things I can say about this place is that the air conditioning works, and it
wasn't too crowded when I visited.  I have visited BA and partner lounges worldwide.  This one is the worst by miles. Not recommended, obviously.",2,-1.015756808
Alan Lacey,New but cramped and uninviting. No pc's so if you don't have a laptop its a  minute trek back though the airport to find the internet facility. No information boards and staff offer no information unless asked. No update announcements. I arrived for a . pm flight and it was already known that there was at least a three hour delay but this was not mentioned ( the aircraft was still on the ground at AMS and had to do a rotation to Gatwick and back before our flight ). The flight eventually took off at midnight - during that time there were no announcements no apology and passengers were sharing information they gleaned by questioning the staff at the desk Even when they called the flight at . - presumably to turf us out of the lounge - after a  minute walk to the gate we found the aircraft was still disembarking. No offer of food vouchers during the  hour delay and the small plate of sandwiches soon disappeared around  pm leaving us with crisps or crackers. Really not good enough and should be scored zero for comfort food and service,1,-1.798894906

M Cadger,First the good points - its very large with plenty of seating and staff were friendly plus you can pay at door if not on ticket that includes entry (or have required membership level). Has lager on draught which you never see in UK lounges. On the poor side - if you are used to BA lounges in UK do not expect anything like Galleries for food and drink options - limited to small rolls with cheese or chorizo crisps or small pastries. basic stock of spirits and limited wines. Wifi signal was not great but that's not unusual in smaller airports.,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,Very poor. This is the th time I have been to the lounge and against expectations it was even worse than before. Overcrowded hot poor food lame selection of drinks inconsistent internet and a location which is remarkably inconvenient this is lounge to miss. Staff? What staff! No-one showed an interest and little action to clean refresh the food or make us feel welcome. Quite why BA continue with it I am not sure - I can only assume that none of their staff have used it.,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,Very good space excellent staff good views range of drinks disappointing and predictable food. The T lounge is very good - a wide range of different sitting spaces great views of the runways and aircraft delightful staff and a very strong range of drinks. Relaxed and welcoming. The minus is that the food offering has remained the same for at least  years and is modest in its range and quality - disappointing.,4,0.550519389
J Clark,Quite a tight little lounge however adequate. I was the first in for the . flight to LHR. Nice selection of breakfast foods and drink. Papers and magazines all in order. The wifi was a bit slow and dropped quite frequently. Interestingly there were quite a few birds yes birds in the lounge that made it feel quite exotic. Obviously not a feature but watching the sing and fly around my head did make me smile. The lounge was between gates  and  and our gate was . Which did mean a bit of a schlep to the gate!,4,0.550519389
William Delaney,Absolute disgrace. BA should be ashamed (but obviously are not). There are enough negative reviews online - but it has to be experienced to be believed. Filthy torn upholstery. Food selection that resembles a self service cafeteria in a 's service station on the motorway. I was sent a survey by text from BA as I walked out of the lounge after being there for  minutes. I let them have my thoughts and they did call me. They assured me the lounge was going to have a multi million pound refurbishment - great but it doesn't help me and as I pointed out why is the lounge allowed to fall into this state of disrepair?,1,-1.798894906
C Moreira,British Airways both in first class as the executive uses the new T  in Sao Paulo Business Lounge TAM.

Christopher Slater-Walker,There's nothing like a good lounge before your flight to make things easier - and this is nothing like a good lounge. It is the worst lounge I've ever used. Having said that it isn't quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about  minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge,,
B Motto,I visited the new British Airways lounge yesterday after a  minute treck across the roof tops of the terminal building exposed to the elements. Do bare in mind that the  minute treck is just to get the new lounge you will need to add at least  minutes to get to the departure gates & through security. The new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities. The refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks. The furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space. At the moment I would not entertain visiting the British Airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of  as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate. Once again British Airways have missed the boat on redesigning something which could be wonderful for their passengers.,2,-1.015756808
A Patterson,Read some poor reviews but we had a few hours to wait so thought we should at least try the lounge. The hostess was pleasant and promptly checked us in and provided a quick overview. Lots of seating was available so we picked a couple of seats with power outlet. The seats were well maintained clean and comfortable. A couple of ladies came around frequently to clear dishes and we found them very pleasant. Food was a nice potato and leek soup and sandwiches. Sandwiches weren't the best. Good selection of refreshments. Would happily return.,4,0.550519389
C Perree,I use this lounge five times a year. Today I arrived from a  hour flight and had a four hour stop over before my next flight. I arrived in the lounge at .am - It was heavingno comfortable chairs to sit in and relax after a long flight dirty plates cups and rubbish left on most tables. I went to the ladies loo which had a long queue but very clean - and for a shower which I did not have to wait for which were clean and very good. Sadly the lounges area seems to be full to bursting on most occasions when I visit - it used to be a quiet relaxing lounge but on two occasions I have left and used my Priority Pass for the quieter No. Lounge downstairs. BA really need to enlarge this lounge as it really doesn't cope with the volume of passengers using it anymore. The staff are always helpful but there does need to be more of them in busy periods. The food is of very good quality and choice (much better than on the flights).,4,0.550519389

I write this sitting in the somewhat less publicized lounge in pier B the gate area for non Schengen departures. There is a good view of the airfield but the windows overlook the less interesting apron and I have yet to figure out where today's active runway is located. The rest rooms are located outside the lounge and like the United Club at EWR there is no hot water in the sinks. Lest I seem like a whiner I should commend the food and beverage offerings.

Ryan Lester,Just awful. Way too many people. Food is terrible. I tried to have a beer but all of them were too warm. Plus there isn't much of a variety much Heineken Tiger or nothing. Wifi is slower than a 's dial up internet line. I travel quite often but even though I'm a Silver Member I rarely use the lounges anymore. I head elsewhere.,1,-1.798894906
B Harrison,Dreadful new lounge. There is a  minute walk to the gate! Via a temporary roof walkway (till April I was told). By the time you have trekked over the roof of the airport it is not worth it. The lounge is small sparse cramped. Few facilities even the toilets are outside. Only breakfast items were small cartons of corn flakes. No milk provided. Thanks BA. Awful lounge not worth the visit.,1,-1.798894906
C O'Brien,Way too busy staff that begrudgingly go about their jobs. Beginning to think that my membership of the executive club is now far less appealing than it used to be. I have travelled extensively on business and generally have a far better experience with Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Even the Lufthansa lounge at Heathrow has a better ambience. BA need to take the time to give this place a much needed uplift. If customers paying premium fares help BA survive more needs to be done to ensure they don't go looking for the premium service they pay for elsewhere.,1,-1.798894906
C Francq,The new lounge is four times the size of the previous one at over  square metres. Reviews here dating back more than  months are therefore obsolete. New lounge very nice in all respects tablet computers are provided for free no password needed for internet access (which used to be limited to one hour previously) Belgian beers on tap mousse au chocolat made of Belgian chocolate - in other words a treat !,5,1.333657488
C Francq,"The Star Alliance lounge at Brussels airport underwent a refurbishment over the past  months. The area has probably tripled and has spacious areas with lounge chairs tables to work comfortable leather couches a quiet business area a sleeping area with ""nap boxes"" lockers for luggage and an improved food selection. The lounge has a luxury feel to it and reminds me of other high-end lounges.",4,0.550519389
A Yamanaka,Very overcrowded small space. Hard to find a seat. No privacy. Very dirty. Wifi with a coupon for hour only but it takes  mins at least to connect and what you get is hardly enough to Google something. No real food. Heavy thick and fat buttered sandwiches soup and beer. No toilet!,2,-1.015756808
Chris Haslam,Lounge was dirty (very dirty) when I visited at  on th January. Staff are beyond rude and standards have continued to drop every time I visit. Have they had a pay cut as they appear seriously unhappy and make an effort to be difficult and offhand to us paying customers. Sadly this is something I have noted onboard as well during last  long haul flights to Chengdu and back. Product is well below Asian airline competitors and Lufthansa and Air France are ahead of BA in the business class game. Amenities catering and service onboard Club World are a joke and I guess the only satisfied travellers are those who have never flown other airlines apart from BA.,1,-1.798894906
R Buxton,All of the ambience and comfort of a hospital waiting room! Cramped with uncomfortable chairs arranged in squares with very few tables for plates and glasses. Poor selection of unappetizing food No showers. No Flight information displays. Very difficult to access with wheelchair - lifts are behind padlocked fire doors. The most disappointing lounge I have visited.,1,-1.798894906
D Moore,Busy busy busy. More people in the lounge than at the bars and restaurants outside. Nowhere to sit for the first hour then table sharing and bag stacking for the rest of my stay. Staff couldn't keep up with the mess and catering demand. Aside from the hr delay the BA lounges have gone downhill fast. Loud and messy chaos!!,3,-0.232618709
A Yamanaka,The terminal B lounge is so small and overcrowded. Also it is unbelievable to have wifi only valid for one hour. The condition of wifi usage is much worse then many of the African airports which the Brussels airlines serve. On top of that there are no bathroom nor shower available in the Terminal B lounge.,1,-1.798894906
Renaat Loos,Worthless lounge. Too small too loud no real food except for some toast and cheese. Luckily sufficient Belgian beers but that could not compensate for the lack of free wifi. You would not believe it still exists in the st century.,2,-1.015756808
S Bain,Awful! No still bottled water - have to use a machine linked to the mains. Only a hot soup type thing and no other hot food. Dried sandwiches horrible coffee. BA - why do you bother with this lounge?,2,-1.015756808
R Whitehouse,I visit Toulouse nearly every week and this is the worst airport lounge I have experienced. Food selection poor drinks even worse which is unbelievable given we're in France - where's the wine? Interior decor is horrendous. The yellow red and green faux leather seats make it look like a 'wacky warehouse'. Its a shared lounge too and therefore way too cramped. BA nearly always has a full flight whenever I travel to TLS so I would expect them to help push for a lounge that its business travellers deserve!,2,-1.015756808
Dag Nygren,"Quite backwards. Not a single gluten free item not even crisps or peanuts. Very few of the seats have AC outlets. The staff tries their best. WiFi cut off. Too small and too crowded. You wouldn't believe that this is the ""capital"" of EU.",2,-1.015756808
S Paice,Just after security for B gates but upstairs from the main concourse. Nice enough lounge although not especially large. Limited seating and very small side tables and the toilets are outside of the lounge in the walkway. Food selection was sandwiches cold meats and cheeses with soup and pastries. Large fridges full of drinks and food quite a pleasant place to spend an hour before the flight home.,4,0.550519389
Max Johnson,An OK lounge designed for short stays and the  hours between my inbound and outbound flights did drag even with a couple of walks. Staff are friendly wi-fi good and complimentary plenty of Belgian beers and other temptations. The food is pretty odd though - a massive tureen of soup a plate of dry and dull sandwiches and some plates of cubed salami and cheese.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,Disappointingly cramped crowded and bare this was a surprisingly disappointing lounge with a paucity of refreshments and even these were in short supply. Given the significance of Schipol I was a little taken aback by the limited facilities (no loos inside the lounge for example). The staff were courteous but little else shone.,3,-0.232618709
D Chamberlain,A good experience. Helpful staff good refreshments in terms of quality and variety. The lounge itself disappoints a little as it has no bathroom facilities inside it and it is a rather plain room but more than adequate. Wifi was good and I suspect much could be improved by altering the seating plan and providing washrooms. Great location next to security and a pleasant enough stay.,4,0.550519389
Guy Senior,A totally different experience from the usual BA self service arrangement which can be great or not so great. Everything is served from cooked to order meals in private booths to drinks at the bar. Generally of top class hotel fit out and a great 'outdoor' terrace overlooking the concourse. Get there early to fully enjoy it. The only annoying matter was the irritating background music. Switch it off!,5,1.333657488
Marc Pauquet,Very cold welcome by the two SN ground staff the lounge is better than international B gate lounge. The catering is poor for a Star Alliance lounge only some dry cake nuts and vegetables - no sandwiches soups and hot dishes. Nice assortment of Belgian beers and beverages. For washrooms you have to leave the lounge and return to the gates entry section.,2,-1.015756808
Mark Austin,What a disappointing lounge. Seems to be designed for short haul where you might spend  mins at most in the lounge. Quite cramped. no washrooms or showers (use public facility outside) no free wifi and very old and tatty computer terminal that has a very slow internet connection. Food comprises a few apples biscuits stale bread rolls and rather poor tub of soup! Staff are polite on entrance door but nothing else - they are silent offer no help and apart from talking to belgian customers we noticed they were actually quite rude to many foreigners. A polite description is that this lounge is a dump!,1,-1.798894906
M Araujo,I liked its quietness. Its cosy with comfortable sofas. Food options are limited but just enough for my needs : rice pasta chicken curry meatballs cheese salad bar snacks. Wine selection is small and champagne is self-service. The staff are attentive at reception and in the lounge. They come around with hot canapes.,5,1.333657488
Jennifer Holford,My partner and I spent a relaxing couple of hours in this lounge. The atmosphere was quiet. Big comfy sofas and chairs a good range of soft drinks beverages and alcoholic drinks available as well as fresh fruit and yogurts in the fridges canapes sandwiches nuts and cakes. We didn't need wifi so can't comment on whether it was available. Previous reviewers have stated that the lounge doesn't have its own loos not true it does. But we did not see any showers available.,3,-0.232618709
T Stead,Pretty poor for a first lounge. I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal,,
M Nunes,Lounge comfortable snacks and drinks sufficient. unable to relax due to noisy kids and to top it all a mouse was spotted running around near our bags. Flight delayed by over  hours this lounge closes at . unfair if your flight is delayed and you have paid for this privilege!,3,-0.232618709
D Chamberlain,Really much improved my last visit here in May. The food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge. The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.,4,0.550519389
S Howard,"I don't like this lounge at all, it is too small, very dated but at least it is clean. My worse complaint is the food choice is awful and very limited, even if you travel in the morning there is no breakfast food. I just wish they would update the lounge and specially give us proper foods. I still strongly recommend Cathay Pacific Airways, but not the Cathay Pacific lounge at Cebu!",1,-1.798894906
Pat Marwick,BA has no control over this lounge as it is shared. Unbelievable that a brand new terminal would have shared facilities. It is an open bland fairly uninteresting space with a section 'cordoned' off for First Class pax. Food and drink the same for everybody. What is totally ludicrous is that in a brand new lounge in a brand new terminal there is only one men's and one women's toilet. Utterly inadequate.,3,-0.232618709
K Lee,I had an evening flight and the lounge was overcrowded. I travelled with a friend and it has very hard to find a place to sit down. There wasn't much space to relax in either once you found a spot. The plus side is that there was a good selection of sandwiches and decent WiFi.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,"Flew BA to Prague and prefer the Cathay Pacific Airways lounge over BA. Food choice was excellent, chose the made to order noodles and they were excellent. A hot buffet was also available and I tried malaysian duck curry and it was great. My companion had carrot cake and cheese and was very happy. Decent choice of drinks and we drank about  flutes of the excellent Verve Clicquot champagne. My companion also had a shower and commented how lovely it was. The lounge had great views of the apron and runaway action.",6,2.116795586
Tim Patrick,"The new lounge has just opened, huge Improvement on the old one. Open to all one world pax. The lounge is neutrally decorated with a good Thai menu. Not much else on offer at the moment but I think they're working on it, great bar and lots of staff around . Well done Cathay!",6,2.116795586
T Patrick,Too busy and small. Lounge used by a variety if other airlines hardly any seats and food drink not so good. I often don't bother. Considering there are so many flights from BKK to HKG I think a bigger lounge needed. Stop messing around with a first class lounge and just make a better one for everyone.,3,-0.232618709
Y Morgan,Very poor low grade business lounge. No champagne on offer unless you ask for it !! But very few staff around to ask. It looks tired with stained upholstery. Seats arranged in long functional rows along the walls - no different from the departure lounges. I normally fly Qatar or Emirates - they both know how to do Business Class -BA has either lost it's way or lost interest. It's been dumbed down to accommodate silver/gold card economy travellers. Fly Qatar or Emirates - even the Virgin Upper Class lounge is better than this.,2,-1.015756808
Guy Senior,BA run lounges are usually good if sometimes overcrowded. Third party lounges like this vary. This one was dreadful - very little food limited range of drinks no computer access and very hard to find. I gave up and went to a bar to get a drink.,1,-1.798894906
N Gates,"This is a fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge. The chairs are comfortable enough. There is just about enough choice of drinks (no Campari) but an extremely limited choice of ""nibbles"" or anything else to eat. Also a very limited choice of newspapers - no Daily Telegraph for example. Our Amsterdam lounge experience was made singularly unpleasant by several lounge users conducting business into their mobile telephones at the top of their voices. After over half an hour of this anti-social behaviour my wife got up and told them that they were making so much noise she was unable to concentrate on the book she was reading. This lounge needs an area reserved for those who wish to utilise mobile telephones at the top of their voices! We were glad to leave the lounge.",2,-1.015756808
T Patrick,Tiny room. Lots of flights from BKK to HKG so already busy really not much there. Also other airlines use it. They really need a bigger one considering the amount of daily flights. Not much food to choose from.,3,-0.232618709
A Huang,Atmosphere is acceptable and the noodle bar is a plus. But the noodle bar is hiding behind the washroom area and didn't even know the first time I was there. The food selection is small. The internet speed was as I tested about - mbps it's ok I guess. Staff courtesy is not so good. Nobody came to greet me at the lounge entrance. Some don't speak good English.,4,0.550519389
A Lee,Surprisingly small in size and lack of the luxury atmosphere which you would expect from an international airport which the airline has three A flight serving daily. Choice for breakfast items were limited - especially hot plates. I don't see chance for big refurbishment of the lounge due to relative size of MEL airport.,4,0.550519389
N Gates,"After Fast Track - instead of being able to walk about thirty yards to the Business (Club) lounge passing through the First Concorde Lounge - you have to walk left descend a floor walk back under where you have just walked and then take an escalater up again. What a nightmare. I am a disabled passenger but I was not allowed to walk through the Concord area to the Business Lounge - I was not amused. Certainly a user-unfriendly route from fast-track to the lounge. The Business Lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly ""tired"". They have stopped providing the Daily Telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing Campari. The chairs and carpets appear very ""well-used"" and some of them appear to be well beyond their ""sell-by"" dates. Food provided was so-so - good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices. When this lounge opened it was wonderful. Today it does not hold a candle to the First Concorde lounge (which I have also used on eleven occasions). Although I recommend the lounge it is with some reservations.",3,-0.232618709
Bill Atkins,This lounge has a real problem With US Airways in Oneworld all AA and US travelers are trying to use it as it is much nicer than the either the Admirals Club or US Airways lounge.Staff are in the unenviable position of turning people away and denying guest privileges to keep it within the fire regulations for capacity. BA clearly needs to restrict to only BA travelers and EC card holders. JAL has no problem doing the same with their First lounge in Chicago due to space limitations.,4,0.550519389
A Matthews,This lounge is outdated needs a total refurb! I would be less than impressed if I had paid club prices for the experience. Furniture old staff rude drink and food selection exceptionally poor. You have to share a bottle of coke and the glasses are filthy and scratched and no wifi!,1,-1.798894906
T Patrick,Agreed with comment made by Michael before considering the amount of BKK-HKG flights the lounge could really be improved. Small food and drink selection nice seating areas and it's quiet though. Hard to find. The Emirates lounge here and even the priority pass one next door are superior. Toilets are outside and there's loads of room to have one inside.,4,0.550519389
Michael Wuest,The lounge is a small place on the Mez floor between the main airport area and the gates in Section G. It is dingy and without much of a view. The furniture seems shipped over from HK as leftovers from the renovation there. Sat through chairs and chipped and worn tables. So it does not matter that people place their feet with the shoes still on on the tables. Staff are friendly (natural for Thai) but that is the best about it all. Drinks are standard only snacks and cup noodle soup on offer here. If you have the option move over to Louis Tavern lounge for superior service and experience.,2,-1.015756808
R Arnett,Very impressed with the quality and service received at all lounges. Amazing washroom facilities and quite areas for relaxing between flights. Food and drink was also very good!,5,1.333657488
Peter Walmsley,I think the earlier reviewer of this lounge must have been in a temporary lounge. The new BA lounge is spacious probably bigger than it needs to be and looks great. A much superior offering to what BA has to offer in other airports eg BKK and MIA. The wine selection is limited with two whites two reds and a champagne. Usual selection of beers and spirits. Good selection of sandwiches and cheese but no hot food other than Heinz tomato soup ! Staff are attentive wifi is good with decent speed. There's is no business centre and no tv screens so overall the lounge is a quiet area.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,I want to like it so much as it was the first lounge I ever used - but it is tired and needs a considerable refit and upgrade. Positives: good supply of drinks (of all types),,
C Hazelford,If you don't like one lounge you can try another and another and another. There is something for everyone and service beverages and calm environment.,5,1.333657488
Nathan Jones,This is the newly refurbished Cathay First Class lounge opposite (though upstairs from) Gate  at Hong Kong airport. I was disappointed and its very average. I understand the new interior is sleek and modern but when you look beyond that there's not much below the service. No snacks unless you go into the Haven for some crusty buffet food and waited several minutes for a shower attendant to appear and when she did she screeched something at me in Cantonese from the end of a hallway gesturing to a refurbished (though standard) shower you would find in any lounge. Aside from the furnishings I would suggest the Business Lounge next door offers more and certainly the QF First Lounge in Sydney or the BA First Lounge at LHR T are far superior. All in all what a disappointing effort from Cathay.,3,-0.232618709
Jeremy Chan,Quite comfortable but generally the size of the lounge is too small and feels a bit crowded and hot. Good wifi connection but not too many food choices available. Staff friendly and very nice. The lounge is located near the gates and flight information is provided which is convenient to passengers.,4,0.550519389
F Klajner,A bad anomaly at the fairly new Ataturk International airport in Istanbul compared with the excellent Star Alliance lounge which I have also used in the past. a scarred wooden floor with large dark gouges dirty armless chairs very closely spaced together dingy lighting a very limited and poor food and drink selection few information monitor screens located far from the boarding gates. In short a disaster rivaled only by the American Airlines lounge in Lima Peru.,2,-1.015756808
A Requena,I had the opportunity to visit the BA first class lounge in terminal . It was really crowded dirty and untidy. I had to make queue to use the bathroom. The food from the buffet was poor and the white wine was warm.,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,Many good features but let down by wifi (you have to pay after  minutes of free use) and food (quality is fine but variety and quantity is disappointing). The drinks selection was very good the comfort certainly good and it was a busy though comfortable atmosphere.Not that easy to find it is friendly enough. The wifi issue is a considerable downside and the food was simply not plentiful enough - long periods without anything other than chips/crisps and then narrow range. Drinks - of all types - were plentiful and good quality. Seating was comfortable though the lack of power sockets was a little surprising.,3,-0.232618709
Y Ren,I heard HK CX first lounge has been renovated but was disappointed. It was still under renovation Entrance staff at ground floor was rude particular the male staff. They treated different passenger differently as well. If you could stay there for a while observing the differences between passengers you will understand where I am coming from. Depends on the time you might be lucky to find a seat. Food at noodle bar is terrible I had some fried dumplings - it was not really cooked some parts still raw. Very limited food option tired staff working at lounge. It cannot compare with QF first lounge in Sydney not even match QF business lounge. Poor service poor quality of food limited space what else left with this lounge?,2,-1.015756808
Alan Wan,Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the apron and runaway and choice of food was excellent this included a buffer style English breakfast with some Singapore noodles but we opted to have some made to order soup noodles - superb. There were other snack and dessert items and a good choice of soft drinks. I had a raspberry juice which was just divine. If you are a One World Emerald member I seriously recommend this lounge at LHR T.,5,1.333657488
B Cleary,Cathay Wing Lounge across from gate . Nice friendly welcome when entering the lounge. Short escalator ride that opens into a very airy setting with multiple seats and hostess around. Ample refreshments snacks and actual meals. Hot tasty and abundant. Lounge is located within easy reach of of Cathay's gates in that area. Plenty of space to work WIFI easy to access. One of the best features is the noodle bar. It is located on the opposite side of the entrance.  Choices and great. If you have a chance to try it -you will be very surprised and glad you took the time!,5,1.333657488
Mark Niall,The lounge is modern and does its job. We had a morning flight at .. The lounge was very crowded bordering on congested. It is self service throughout. Being full made it a bit difficult to obtain food and drinks keep a reserved table and relax T the same time. There are many worse lounges. However BA should look at extending the area or redesigning to make the lounge less congested.,4,0.550519389
Russ King,It is a bit daunting when you first arrive but staff are surprisingly friendly and seemed genuinely interested in looking after you. Good baggage storage so you are free to enjoy. Three parts: the dining area - discreet cubicles with fast service and excellent food,,
A Chan,The newest lounge is quite impressive. Fantastic staff (waiting & counter staff) and a great selection of food. The solus chairs were also enjoyable as they allowed me to work and be comfortable at the same time. The waiting staff were employees of The Peninsula Hotel and made for a great experience.,5,1.333657488
Simon Fraser,The staff here are friendly,,
J Ponthier,I found this lounge quite good for a short stay. Comfortable seating not crowded and good food/drink options available. The smoothie of the day and fresh panini sandwiches were a treat. One downside were the small restroom facilities which could be a problem during peak hours.,4,0.550519389
Chienling You,Food quality is well and a variety of selection offering at the lounge. I enjoy the noodle bar and also dim sum. Staff are friendly and often look around to see if passenger need to be taken care of. The sleeping room is quiet to take a rest. The seat area like small balcony giving a room of privacy.,6,2.116795586
Russ King,This lounge is a room nothing more! Four serving people hovered around a minimal amount of stewed food totally disinterested. Only sweet was ice-cream at the other end of the lounge. It didn't even have a flight screen! No place to leave luggage unlike some other BA lounges. Food was terrible: tough and tasteless. In the end I went to the Qantas lounge - you are allowed there and they were wonderful - they have a chef to cook for you. BA's lounge is a disgrace no views of the apron - only of arrival lounge/immigration. Haphazard boarding meant long queues and no fast-track so a long wait at the gate security.,2,-1.015756808
R Vines,This lounge is generally OK but it wasn't when I arrived late morning on Sunday. It was overcrowded overheated and unpleasant. Most newspapers were unavailable. Having paid hundreds of pounds extra to fly Business on holiday I left immediately and ended up in a Cafe Rouge. I realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but I don't understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average Starbucks or even (on this occasion) CafÃ© Rouge. I suggested to BA that they give me a refund. They said they valued my loyalty but no. Oh well. Fortunately the flight was good but I am assuming lounges are taken into consideration when evaluating airlines for stars and recent lounge experiences have made me wonder if BA's four stars might be too generous.,2,-1.015756808
Jan Fenn,What a shock. The lounge was dated in Poor disrepair and quite frankly grim. It needs refurbishing badly and it was way too small for the number of travellers using it. The No  Lounge is way better but they could learn a lot by visiting the Virgin lounge at Heathrow - it Is a million times better. BA need to buck their ideas up here!,2,-1.015756808
A Vasquez,Very ordinary. Feels like it is in the dungeons of the airport. Limited selection of food drinks. More entertainment available within the terminal.,3,-0.232618709
Simon Hirsch,Showers were good with nice extras. Did not find any computers would appear they only provide wifi. Asked for a cabana but told that's only available in the first section of The Wing. Overall quiet pretty spacious and well positioned.,4,0.550519389
R Glantz,Very basic. Overheated. No shower. No fresh fruit or vegetables. No muffins cookies or crackers. Limited selection of indifferent hot food. Both coffee machines were broken.,3,-0.232618709
R Glantz,The lounge is on two levels. While the lower floor is noisier it has a good noodle soup bar. On balance the lounge is acceptable but not as good as most other business class lounges.,3,-0.232618709
Tachiyama Keisuke,Food quality is very superb. I love the noodle bar. The dim sum selection and beverage selections are plentiful. The shower rooms are very nice. There is plenty of room downstairs although as others have stated it can get extremely busy at night when the flights to North America and Australia are leaving.,4,0.550519389
D Arter,Despite having a BA Business Class ticket I was declined admittance to the Business Class Lounge! The (very helpful polite and just lovely) lady at the BA Customer Service Counter informed my that my ticket wasn't the right type of Business Class ticket to gain access to the lounge. Given the fact I have a One World First Class around the world ticket I have to ask what exactly is an acceptable ticket! The gentleman at the Business Class counter (also terribly polite and most sympathetic and helpful) informed me that QANTAS Frequent Flyer Club members are no longer allowed in the BA Lounge as they no longer pay BA for the privilege! British Airways pick up your game.,1,-1.798894906
N Berry,Great lounge relaxing and food generally good - have noticed cuts in premium spirits crisps and total lack of decent magazines which is a shame as BA makes all it's profit out of its business class passengers.,4,0.550519389
Bill Atkins,I would agree that this lounge is often overcrowded and looks rather frayed now. Staff were friendly on my visit and quick to offer service. Table service good though food selection has lost its shine compared to a couple of years ago.,3,-0.232618709
Peter Van,Cathay Pacific Lounges at HK International Airport used to be a benchmark but have lost their edge over past  years. Overcrowded with wear and tear generally showing throughout. Noodle bars in Business Class lounge or seated dining area okay if you can get a table. Most of the times better to grab a bite to eat outside and use the chairs available at the gates. Cathay needs to take care of premium customers better or accept losing clients.,2,-1.015756808
J Johnson,Just a dreadful experience. The staff was discourteous rude. They ignored my plea for help to correct the wireless problems claiming they could not speak English or help me. It was as if I was troubling their time when I was flying first transpacific and waiting for another lengthy flight onward. The shower was clean if basic. The buffet food sub-par. The lounge looks unclean and tired and not worthy of first class.,1,-1.798894906
Brian Smith,The food is varied with hot Thai dishes fresh fruit sandwiches cakes and many drink options including fresh young coconut. The flight was delayed and though we were given a coupon for a meal in the terminal there was no need to use it with what was on offering the lounge. The wifi worked but the two computers with Thai keyboards in their business area did not. Friendly and efficient staff. Only complaint is that there is no toilet in the lounge.,4,0.550519389
Brian Smith,Decent food and drink options but nothing spectacular. Comfortable and in a convenient location. The front desk staff does not have a computer connected to the reservations system so the poor attendant could not do anything besides check to see if we were legitimate to enter or not.,4,0.550519389
H Koher,Not a fan. It was very crowded as I arrived for a late flight to Taipei. Hard backed chairs no couches or lounge chairs of any type. Very limited plugs to recharge electronics. There was a piece of paper taped to the beverage machine showing some complex code to get access to the wifi even when entered it didn't work luckily got on via the Air France lounge which must be close by. Limited beverage choices. Very bad food. Tiny albeit functional bathroom. If I had known how bad it was I would have stayed in the Delta lounge in the domestic terminal.,2,-1.015756808
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Excellent lounge from which BA could learn a great deal. Very comfortable seating with good views of the apron and runways and superb food. The food was fresh and delicious with a station cooking rice or noodle stir fry dishes to order. Maybe the best hot food in an airport lounge I have ever experienced.,4,0.550519389
P Alderson,I was allowed access as I had just travelled to Heathrow with BA in First. My excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived. It looked congested and untidy. The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic. After waiting  minutes for a coffee I quickly drank it and went to the First/Gold lounge which had a more comfortable and relaxing ambience.,3,-0.232618709
T Cho,Maybe it was the time I visited this lounge but there were so many passengers entering but not enough seats. After walking around for  minutes with my wife and daughter I was finally able to secure some seats. Granted the area around the seat had not been cleaned for a while which resulted in heaps of dirty plates and glasses. With seats secured I waited to see if anyone would clean up the plates/glasses. Someone did arrive  minutes later to clean it up. The lounge was chaotic around -pm on a Saturday with way too many people and not enough seats. The noodle bar is always good but the sandwiches and other items were not as good. Good supply of drinks/ beverages. As another poster stated the lounge is really showing wear and tear. It is sad because this lounge and The Pier are the barometer for all other Cathay Pacific lounges. Another gripe I had was the elevator that connects the lounge to the departure gates way too small and slow. If I was in a rush I probably would have missed my flight despite it only being  minutes away at Gate . It may be better to grab a bite to eat outside and enjoy the spacious seats at the gates if the lounge continues to be way it was when I visited.,3,-0.232618709
David Walker,I little dated and old despite the newness of the Airport. Friendly welcoming staff not bad choice of drinks and food. None of the electric sockets worked where I was seated. Not too crowded. Internet and computers available for public use.,3,-0.232618709
James Henderson,Friendly efficient staff compliment a large open plan lounge the looks out over the airport. There is a great little restaurant style noodle bar with a selection of Chinese food but watch out if you are looking for more western cuisine as it is lacking. So to is the selection of drinks which seems to have shrunk in recent years possibly due to cut backs. There is a large room with multiple PC terminals for good reliable internet surfing. Wi-Fi is free and up to par with speed and reliability. Restrooms and Shower cubicles are small and showing a little wear and tear as the years go by. However they are clean! Overall this is a great lounge but slowly starting to show some of its age.,4,0.550519389
Stuart Walker,China Airlines use the Alitalia lounge which give that Rome is their home base the lounge is poor. Why is it that airlines think that putting a lounge where there are no windows is good. Food and drink selection poor seating unimaginative toilets dirty.,2,-1.015756808
Paula Loguda,Very basic seating. No view at all. Food very limited although the noodle bar was good. Shower rooms clean but too complicated. Plenty of computer and internet terminals. In the late evening when the North American and Australian flights are due to leave gets very busy with shortage of seats,3,-0.232618709
P Miller,I had just earned my Silver Executive Club membership and was looking forward to trying out a lounge on my own account without being a guest of one of my better traveled colleagues. Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the s,,
A Evans,A very small and miserly stocked lounge. No hot food small selection of booze and no espresso.,3,-0.232618709
T Cho,The lounge was small compared to other Cathay lounges I have been at. There was the ever constant noodle bar serving up good food. They had two types of sandwiches (vegetarian and w/ meat) and they had cake + chinese dim sum. Good varieties of drinks including premium liquor and soft drinks. The lounge itself does not compare to the Wing or Pier lounges in HK but for Taipei it provides a nice oasis for travelers to eat and drink prior to their flight. It is a better alternative to the lacklustre duty free that is provided at Taoyuan airport. If there try the beef noodles in soup and not the spicy peanut sauce based noodles. There was free wifi and it was fast as well. Overall a very nice place to spend an hour or two before one's flight.,4,0.550519389
B Stewart,Haven't been to this lounge since before the renovations but what a difference. Great layout with a combination of lounge seating bar and workstations along the lines of other CX lounges and plenty of filtered light. Good food drink and reading material selections.,5,1.333657488
Nick Fortuna,As a Diamond Frequent Flyer I enjoy this lounge quite regularly. And regularly experience the comfort excellent service wonderful showers fantastic staff great catering and the WOEFUL internet connection. Which drops out regularly. It seems three wireless services are available but they seem to drop out randomly without rhyme or reason. Even while typing this the connection failed twice. Not good enough Cathay Pacific.,4,0.550519389
T Holder,Very nice little and quiet lounge right at the back of the terminal. Staff were very attentive. The food wasn't great and neither was the choice just a few sandwiches and biscuits to choose from. The wifi was fast and the lounge was clean. But there was a queue in front of the washrooms because there is pretty limited capacity.,4,0.550519389
Michael Davies,An oasis of calm in what can be a busy terminal . Always plenty of seats with many overlooking the runway. It never seems busy here even though its used by American Airlines and now US Airways. An am departure - good choice of continental breakfast items. Everything you would expect from a lounge.,5,1.333657488
Patrick DuPlessis,Have to say I was rather disappointed with this flagship lounge for Cathay. It seems to have a rather worn appearance the seats were quite tatty and dirty same for carpet areas and staff service was cold at very best. Nicest staff was the lady cleaning the shower rooms! Did not get to use the cabanas this time but found the shower-rooms rather cramped and dull for a first class facility in Asia. Had a snack in the dining room area and whilst it was quite good again I found the staff to be quite offhand and poor. Had problems with wifi but probably my fault and not that of the lounge service here.,3,-0.232618709
F Chan,Large lounge. Reasonably comfortable with ample seating some overlooking the aircraft apron. Many Internet stations in good working condition. Well-stocked with snacks and drinks including Dim Sum and wine. Good selection of magazines and newspapers. Two shower rooms and a few toilet cubicles all in sparkling condition. The lounge is not enclosed but sits open-air one level above the general departure area accessible by escalator and lift.,4,0.550519389
George Forgan-Smith,Not much has changed since my last visit to this lounge. Seats were old and dirty. Food selection was mediocre at best. The redeeming quality of this lounge is the attentiveness and willingness of the staff to help the guests.,4,0.550519389
Gordon Wallace,The new lounge at Glasgow is a vast improvement on the old one very well laid out good selection of food and drinks. Staff on the desk very helpful and the lounge staff very attentive at both replenishing food/drinks as well as clearing used glasses etc away. Top tip sit in the whiskey snug hidden around the back and with no one in it. Only slight draw back is that it's not immediately at the gate but can live with that.,5,1.333657488
Clive Billingham,First time in this Lounge. Very disappointing pm food was curry chilli jacket potato with beans - really inspiring. Tables left dirty for over  minutes.,2,-1.015756808
G Hampton,Lounge is ok but front desk staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. We were travelling with small children and needed a little extra assistance but no such luck. Highlights yet again vast difference in treatment between UK BA lounges and those stateside where your gold card often seems as welcome as tax bill.,3,-0.232618709
Robert Walbeek,"Nice lounge, spacious, clean and cool. Very nice lunch with plenty of choices of cooked food and sandwiches. No alcohol which is a pity because the food deserves a nice glass of red wine.",6,2.116795586
Kenji Masuda,Cathay Pacific really underestimated the frequency of the shower room. It's always more than an hour waiting while I only have  hours transit time.,3,-0.232618709
Tony Hall,Furnishings and refreshments fine for the amount of custom but there were no showers available and the nearby toilets were out of use. The there computers available but the internet connection was extremely poor and very unreliable.,3,-0.232618709
D Larmour,Food quality has gone down especially if you're looking for any protein. Breakfast before transatlantic flight was largely a selection of pastries and other unhealthy options. No cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants. The food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection. I asked for cheese and was rudely told there's none available before noon if then. The toilets are often smelly and not clean enough. There is often a queue to get in. It's a shame BA don't realize how this damages their brand. They've been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges it's really apparent. Hardly worth paying the extra fares,,
D Larmour,Pretty awful. No wifi or printers working. Food minimal and very drab. Quite crowded not much space. Toilets far away outside.,2,-1.015756808
P Hauser,"The best word is ""rudimentary"".  Certainly not even close to anything offered by China Eastern Airlines  peers in Asia, or even airlines from North America.  The lounges were clean, and there was
food and some drinks, but poor. They're very basic in the seating department and rather plain.  Gin and warm tonic water were supplied, but no ice.  Wifi is impossible to connect-to unless one has a Chinese mobile telephone number.  There were no shower facilities available.  We went next-door to the First class lounge, it was pretty much the same as the business class lounge. China Eastern offer a comfortable, professional and pleasant inflight experience in business class.  The lounge experience doesn't even come close.",2,-1.015756808
N Wallace,"Small crowded very . On the bright side no blaring CNN or other stupid American TV ""news"" shows because you're in China! No monitor to check flight details. Announcements are made in sort of English but were so muffled and unintelligible to be useless. Very tired looking and in desperate need of a refit. Staff sort of want to help but don't really know how to.",2,-1.015756808
Pierre van der Poel,What can I say this is so disgusting one would think that China Eastern could ensure that business travellers have a decent lounge at their flagship airport. Very poor wifi and no music or even CNN The lounge is dirty even the walls and chairs are falling apart how embarrassing for a nation that prides themselves on being ahead of the rest of the world clearly not in this arena.,1,-1.798894906
D Stead,Overall extremely disappointing. I used the lounge on a Saturday am - .pm Large lounge with comfortable chairs and free wifi as you would expect little choice of newspapers no phone/tablet charging points. Coffee etc available choice of wines and spirits if you are hungry I suggest you eat beforehand! Hot food consists of toast. Cold food consists of fruit salad plain yoghurt in a large bowl (not single pots) ham and cheddar cheese plus pastries & biscuits. Heathrow has slightly more choice incl hot food.,4,0.550519389
L Shore,The British Airways staff at T certainly didn't go to charm school. Awful choice of food ended up with a jacket potato lounge lacked character and looked dirty. Staff on the entrance uninterested and took no notice of me. The toilets in the business lounge were so dirty I changed my mind about taking a shower!,2,-1.015756808
Alex Guo,This is a domestic first (business) class lounge for China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines. Visited twice in the last  weeks and I'd say that this lounge is below average. No outside view of any kind. Boarding notifications shouted by staff. Stir fries and rice offered during meal time but not delicious and attractive at all. Some salad sandwiches dessert and other snacks available. Soft drinks plenty with some beer and wine. Used plates collected from time to time. Washrooms were clean. Biggest complaint is the wifi - uses public wifi which is extremely slow. Overall I only recommend because it has couches (more comfortable than the benches outside) and provides free drinks and edible food but don't come with high expectations.,3,-0.232618709
K Hart,Very poor lounge. Food is terrible chairs old dirty and uncomfortable. Staff unfriendly. Better to wait at boarding gate.,2,-1.015756808
E Agamennone,I had just become an Eastern Miles Golden Member but did not have the card with me yet. I asked the girl at the entrance of the lounge to let my -month pregnant wife to enter the lounge with me (something I was entitled to as Golden Member) also considering there were only  minutes left before boarding. The staff refused saying they wanted to see the card. I therefore entered the lounge alone: packed as usual (for Chinese it is extremely easy to join the lounge through their credit card membership) some average noodles sandwiches and fruit. I expressly asked the staff to let me know if the gate changed (it happens frequently in China) and they did not do that. Overall the standard terrible China Eastern's service.,2,-1.015756808
G Sims,Not made to feel especially welcome and when we were there at lunchtime there were not many places left to sit. Not crowded but very 'busy'. The hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup! That was all - and some weird croutons. Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night. Overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at Heathrow and overseas in Middle East down at the bottom of the list - desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors.,3,-0.232618709
J Henson,I visited this lounge on  May . Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language. Luggage storage available. Toilet located outside lounge. Overall a pleasant (albeit not amazing) place to spend an hour before a flight.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,For such a fantastic potential this remains a disappointing lounge. Wonderful views a very large area pretty good seating light and airy - all good. However: after over an hour in here we are getting the first sign of a cleaner,,
N Bharadwaj,Although the food is decent in terms of quantity and quality the furniture is old and highly uncomfortable. Not many electric plug points for recharge etc. No announcements either.,2,-1.015756808
B Buth,Poor service of staff! Don't think it is their job to inform guests of delays ( hours). Nobody cleans up after departed guests (or way too slowly). Food served is all packaged crackers and cling wrapped sandwiches. Chairs are old - seats in the public area of the terminal are more comfortable.,2,-1.015756808
B Cleary,There are a few lounges located throughout the terminal with easy access to all gates. Attendants were very accommodating and explained the comforts of the lounge and that they would make a boarding call. Many hot appetizers as well as Asian / Western Dishes available. Well stocked bar as well as soft drinks water and tea. Assortment of Asian and English language newspapers. WIFI worked well and the  hours spent in the lounge were very pleasant.,5,1.333657488
Mark Boggis,Food non existent staff unhelpful totally unimpressed. Internet wireless not working correctly either. Can't wait to get on the plane and get out of this hole.,2,-1.015756808
Michael Davies,Both the north and south lounges in TA are superb. Reception staff always friendly despite some miserable people who seem to complain a lot and should be kicked back to the public areas. The lounges are always busy but there are plenty of seats of many types. The showers are excellent staffed by such friendly ladies and whilst there is often a queue to use the toilets they are spotlessly clean. Good choice of food of sandwiches salads and hot items. The lentil and bean curry was spicy and excellent as was the Thai red curry. Two types of perfectly cooked rice or baked potato. Wide range of alcoholic drinks. The wifi is free easy to log on and of good enough speed despite many people using it. And a great view over airport. I always look forward to coming here.,5,1.333657488
A Hickling,Visited the Concorde Room on  May and used it for around ten hours. I stored my hand luggage with the attendant and proceeded to the dining area for breakfast. All food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day. If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork. My only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly.,5,1.333657488
Chris Anderson,Good lounge big and bright very clean I was there at breakfast and a variety of westernish and Chinese hot and cold dishes were available. Good fast wifi available and comfy chairs.,4,0.550519389
Andrew Nethercott,Lounge has been refurbished to include uncomfortable seating used to be a nice comfy lounge. Snacks and drinks not too bad. Not a place to spend  hours (any more).,3,-0.232618709
Chris Anderson,Small lounge close to gate  at terminal  with portable wall surrounds to divide from the rest of the waiting area quite noisy because of the walls and also very busy as were all other lounges. Simple snacks and drinks available plus cold Tsingdao beer and red wine. Not bad for a domestic lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Smallish lounge shared by several airlines. Very pleasant staff and free bar for BA customers. Excellent showers mediocre food offerings. Other airline users pay for alcoholic beverages.,4,0.550519389
Annabel Wharton,Rome Fiumicino Arrivals Terminal is a nightmare but International Departures Terminal Four is state of the art. Even on the busiest weekend of the yearâ€”canonization of John Paul II and John XIIIâ€”the space was remarkably civilized. The terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge. We were flying Turkish Airlines - in Rome they use British Airways executive lounge. The lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it. Apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of Rome the space is clinical. Solid blocks of rectilinear grey-beige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten -â€“the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others. One side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied. Especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the anti-intimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance. The floor carpeted in a non-descript blue felt-like substance is not as might be expected flat. Rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble. Internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access. Once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager. The culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting. We were arrived at  p.. lunchtime. Cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies. Breakfast apparently lasts all day at the BA lounge. There was a self-serve bar which included red and white wine. The red came in a Bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box. Our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait.,2,-1.015756808
J Ritchie,Absolutely shocking. Stale and tasteless lumps of bread. Food in fact that I would be more likely to throw out. Disinterested staff. Without doubt with regards to the food on offer this was the worst I'd ever been to. Nothing to do with British Airways incidentally. We were given access by means other than our airline tickets.,2,-1.015756808
Chris Anderson,Pretty good lounge PVG has lounges located at most international gate ares so not overcrowded. Good selection of hot food and snacks when I was there around pm and good bar variety too. Wifi worked well and English papers and magazines available too.,4,0.550519389
M Labanich,More than adequate lounge separate from business class. Hostess helpful and friendly. Electrical outlets for last minute computer/ pda charging are abundant. Nice selection of hot/ cold food both western and Asian,,
R Min,In general this lounge was an average one to all the ones I been to. This lounge was also empty. They had a bad section of food but it tasted okay. The lounge felt and looked boring. The lounge had no internet but it had power points. The bathrooms were good but lacked showers. The staff were friendly.,3,-0.232618709
Alan Wan,For a small airport this lounge was excellent. It was elegant clean and had a respectable selection of food and beverage.,4,0.550519389
Christopher Slater-Walker,The worst business lounge I've ever seen. There is little food available,,
O Ekland,At OSL BA uses the OSL lounge (owned by airport authorities). I often take the late BA flight to LHR after work. If hungry eat somewhere else - food and beverages are below standard for BA lounges. Decent selection of newspapers. Best feature: The lounge is wonderfully quiet. So worth visiting after long day at work to wind down before the flight. Very comfortable chairs and sofas (though not particularly modern or elegant) and a quiet atmosphere. I like it. About  mins walk to BA gates from lounge.,4,0.550519389
C Padeste,The quality of the food is dropping every time I spend some times in this lounge. Chilli con carne without proper rice ice cream fridge empty quality of wine getting lower and lower. I also found surprising that nothing is done in the last year to fix some power sockets that do not work (next to seat or on the PC table). It seems that BA believe that quality of service is not important for the price of ticket you have to pay. Maybe they will have a wake-up call like Lufthansa when people will fly different airlines.,3,-0.232618709
K Sveningsen,I think the standard has gone downhill. It's not as clean as before. The wine is mediocre. No bread or nice cheese. The coffee beans are not the same. No more nice different cookies just a pot with a cookie that's has the taste of nothing. I was happy to pay the price for Club to be able to get in. But as for now no way.,3,-0.232618709
Saiyed Dean,"Well below expectation for a First/Business class lounge. Poor food and beverage choice and very limited options for an international traveller. China Southern Airlines Staff at lounge desk do not communicate at all. Poor communication and very, very limited English spoken. Unable to communicate when there are delays or changes. Very poor announcements made. Speaker was broken and sitting behind a cabinet so added to the poor English, unable to hear what was being said. Could not connect to Wifi - staff unhelpful, unwilling to assist. Due to  hour delay in flight this was a very painful experience to be stuck here for  hours !",1,-1.798894906
Alan Wan,Plenty of light snacks of crisps flapjacks brownies biscuits and soup. The choice of drinks was impressive choice of wines beers and spirits. The lounge ambience was not the best but very functional. Something to note if you arrive early the check in desks may not be open until a couple of hours before departure and the self service machines will no longer be available.,4,0.550519389
H Blumenthal,You need to have the One World Gold card to access this lounge if you're travelling business class. Lounge offers space,,
R King,Spotlessly clean relaxing and fantastic views of airside and runway. Service by staff very friendly and welcoming. There is storage for your luggage if you want to dump everything and relax or walkabout (though Newark airport has few shops/duty-free). Lounge only has  shower. The food really was amazing. Worth getting to the airport early enough to eat.,5,1.333657488
Peter Elliott,"Our transit stop of  hours turned into  due to aircraft delays. The lounge is on  levels with main eating downstairs and more limited offerings upstairs. The food for evening meal was mainly Asian style but most westerners would find something of their liking. There is not much of a variety of wine and alcohol but plenty of juice, soft drink and tea/coffee. Showers are available but you need to book at lounge reception. The lounge is reasonably comfortable and there is a free massage chair. There was one newspaper printed in English.",6,2.116795586
P Carpenter,Used twice tired lounge with electric sockets rather tired (upstairs the seat lighting kept not working as plugs fell out). Showers good but have seen wear. Massage chairs good. A lot of cleaners with minimal English and one or two higher staff who have okay english.,3,-0.232618709
S Avant,In a very basic cold airport this lounge was just okay. As its not very busy there seemed to be enough seating and is fairly comfortable. Staff are tolerant of us but not endearing. The food was fine if you didn't want anything European and there was no alcohol to speak off other than a white red and Kirrin Beer. The classic is that they have a closed smoking room that everyone was using. Each time we left the lounge to stretch our legs we were challenged on our return to show that we were entitled to be there. Just like China Southern their lounge is okay if you can get your head around the fact that its a Chinese airline not a European one!,3,-0.232618709
Alan Wan,Very spacious and great views. We experienced breakfast and lunch which were adequate but not as good as the Heathrow T lounge. The hot food was too limited. Porridge and soup offerings were tasty and nice champagne.,4,0.550519389
C Lambie,Use this lounge - times a month and position is okay subject to which A gates you board from. It is cramped not just at peak times and BA seem to have become complacent about improving this. Toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant. Food is at Travelodge level (UK travellers will know what I mean) and fails to match standards at some better European airline lounges. Staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and I think these must be the ones that didn't make the grade at charm school. Don't get me wrong I like BA but their lounge standards (including First) here at Terminal  are now poor.,2,-1.015756808
Paul Whiteley,I appreciate this lounge is never going to be empty but I always find the lounge too busy to be comfortable. On my last visit just before New Year cups and glasses took a relative age to be removed and the food choices seemed less than usual along with having to queue to use the toilet. I've had decent stays in this lounge but the last two visits haven't been relaxing or pleasurable. It's got to the point where I've ended up at the Espresso cafe at the very end of the southern part of T.,3,-0.232618709
G Wang,The lounge is spacious - about - seats. The sofas are comfortable and the room is clean. A refrigerator is stocked with - different types of beverages. The food is more a brunch style with several Chinese style breakfast items and a few western style lunch options. I was not hungry that day and I only tried the breakfast porridge and dessert cake. They were both good. The internet is fast with good signal strength.,4,0.550519389
J Whiteley,Quite basic no frills. Breakfast is poor staff are not friendly. Seats are ok if I had to spend a long time in this Lounge I would not be happy.,2,-1.015756808

Paul Whiteley,BA use the JAL Sakura Business Lounge at NRT. Spacious clean and a separate dining area if one wanted to eat. Decent tarmac views. Nice lounge and a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,Disappointing and poor quality. From the challenge in finding the lounge to the surly receptionist to the very poor range of snacks this was a real disappointment. I was flying British Airways and it is to be hoped that they will try to persuade the airport to improve this lounge. Small in size basic in furnishings poorly lit. One bottle of wine only in the whole lounge and a choice of one type of beer. Snacks with very little choice and poor quality. Lavatories were outside of the lounge. Unhelpful staff.,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,Much improve. They have enlarged the lounge and offer a reasonable range of snacks sandwiches and drinks. The beer/wine is fine and the snacks of a good quality. Friendly staff and excellently located. Clean well maintained. I suspect they will need to upgrade it more for the  World Cup as it is relatively basic by some standards but is none the less safe quiet clean and friendly. I have been to this lounge many times -it does its job.,3,-0.232618709
Barry Keating,My visit was from -hrs. At that time it was not crowded and the service level by staff and the food was excellent. Quick tip - On arrival at the lounge book the Clairol  minute massage or facial this is free. All in all a very good experience.,4,0.550519389
C Sato,I and my husband travelled from LA to Tokyo via Guangzhou on last week. Their lounge is one of the best lounge we have been in. The staff were very helpful. We could spent a good time in classy place.,5,1.333657488
V Hinkov,Beijing-Brisbane via Guangzhou in C class. It looks really amazing very comfortable both upstairs and downstairs. I also had a shower It was the best shower room at airline lounge. Boarding information behind mirror - wow really impressive. But the service at this lounge is just not up the standard. Staff cold and not helpful particular the chef. He was rude and unhelpful I ordered some dumplings on the menu but until my flight start boarding I did not see dumpling anywhere. All in all great facility but unacceptable service.,4,0.550519389
Chris Willett,I am a gold member with BA. On th December I was flying to Tampa with my wife and three youngsters that we care for access to the lounge was denied which I accepted but not having seen the notice not to remove refreshments when I took three small soft drinks and three packets of crisps out to the children I was virtually attacked on my return with a BA staff member waving his finger at me stating it was a massive No no for me to do this. I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored. BA have responded to my complaint stating that they have passed my concerns onto the LGW management team.,2,-1.015756808
J Tung,Busy lounge in TA South before New Year. Very dark and uninviting. Limited viewing area most of the seats face inward the building. Very limited choice of food - few sandwich one soup and some cakes. Good selection of wines but depends on where you sit. Good wifi. Service was very slow (not attentive) and the receptionists weren't welcoming. A very disappointing lounge.,3,-0.232618709
J Tung,Terrace Lounge in Aberdeen has just been renovated. Friendly staff spacious seating/working area and good selection of soft drink also one red/white wine on offer. Food is limited to sandwich and cakes but that's sufficient for a regional airport.,4,0.550519389
Andrew Nethercott,Fantastic lounge good food reasonable selection of drinks friendly staff and so comfortable. They even a have large screen TV with one area set out like a cinema for those long stays and they staff are always on hand to find you a movie in English or Chinese. Could not complain about anything.,5,1.333657488
Rob Schuiling,Nothing to write home about. No windows for viewing limited choice of food (packed crackers etc.) and drinks (instant coffee). Recently enlarged to create more space and seats making it a bit more comfortable but in peak hours still busy. This is also due to airport or airline staff using it to invite friends in. Also no wifi available just some PC's for general use (mostly occupied). No showers I have noticed. Staff can be attentive (depending on individual style) but English remains an issue with most of them. There is a first class lounge  meters away but it never seems to be open when I am around for catching early morning flights ( am)? Compared with the domestic lounge at the same airport the international lounge is not up to the standard.,2,-1.015756808
K Bong,This new lounge opened just a week ago. It is absolutely appalling. There is no food All the trays are empty. Juice dispensers are empty. Coffee machines don't work. Only a few packets of cheap biscuits in a basket. When I asked the staff (who was rude and unhelpful) if the trays and juice dispensers would be refilled the answer was no and he walked away. This was am. The lounge looks pleasant and comfortable enough. In the end orange juice was made available but we would have to approach the staff to ask for it. WIFI is not free.,2,-1.015756808
L Shurey,Not an experience I will repeat  poor service very slow which in hindsight was a blessing given the quality of the food when it finally arrived. To see how a lounge should be run fly Qatar Airways.,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,This might not have the 'wow factor' of Terminal  lounges it is very good. A fairly long trek to get there but efficient friendly professional more spacious than you first think. Good internet excellent range of wines. Food is good quality though a little lacking in variety and with tiny plates! Good variety of seating and very pleasant environment. You can work relax sleep or whatever you need to here. Clearing up service seems a little under staffed as used plates and glasses can take a long time to be collected - but BA would benefit from more staff on this duty the ones who are there are good.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,bustle of the main terminal. Very efficient staff clearing away welcoming reception staff. Breakfast food is excellent. Wide selection of excellent wines and other drinks. Good internet and very clear information boards. It does get busy of course but manages this well. Clean bathrooms.,5,1.333657488
D Chamberlain,Very good overall. I have visited this lounge a number of times - the variety of food can be a little inconsistent at times but the quality is good with a good mix of cold and warm snacks salads etc. Good range of drinks and nice selection of wine - though it is a pity that the Cava has seemingly been withdrawn! Comfortable large bright with natural light and excellent view of the runway - huge glass front the lounge which extends along its whole length. Reception is friendly and professional. Wifi system is frustrating - you have to collect scratchcards from reception which only last  minutes - seems unnecessary. Its a little bit of a challenge to find the lounge but well worth when you do.,4,0.550519389
R Lightbody,FCO-LGW I entered the lounge after a long a hot journey to the airport. The lounge was quiet and it was being shared by the other one world airlines. There was no hot or cold food there were only crisps. There were plenty of drink options. I was very disappointed as British Airways have a few flights out of Rome to London Heathrow London Gatwick and London City.,2,-1.015756808
R Vines,Surprisingly poor. The pre-flight buffet was unappetizing. I found nothing I wanted to eat and the staffer on the door to that section (keeping away other airline's passengers) was unfriendly to the point of rudeness. The main lounge is horribly lit. You have to find someone if you want a glass of Champagne and there are not that many staff around. It is so different from Virgin's lounge at JFK I'm just confused. By contrast the BA lounge at City Airport in London is fine.,3,-0.232618709
R Vines,The BA all-business service to JFK was a fine flight. The lounge at City is surprisingly good for a fairly small space. The snacks and drinks were fine and staff serving was friendly and efficient. (The hike to the washrooms is tiresome.),3,-0.232618709
H Rowe,I received complimentary use of this lounge when I took an Iberia flight that connected in NY. I heard that BA has great lounges so I was looking forward to it. It was a letdown to say the least. I was greeted to  stale inch-wide sandwich slivers on a tray set off to the side. Bottles of water had not been replenished. I was starving and asked they would be replenishing food/drinks etc. I was told that everything would arrive around  - when I asked this question it was about  pm. It was also extremely hot in the lounge,,
J Segal,Found the room to be spacious and spread out - tables seemed full and walked around to find open spots at a community table. Food well laid out and offered variety of breakfast items (hot and cold) with juice beverages and coffee available. Staff helpful. No flight announcements so had to watch the board. Wifi as well as a couple of computers to use.,4,0.550519389
Richard Berger,British Airways Galleries First lounge at JNB is the worst airport lounge I have visited. BA should be absolutely ashamed to call this a lounge much less a first class lounge. Slow unusable internet poor or non-existent service. Lousy food which is identical to the adjoining business lounge Champagne sitting in lukewarm water with no ice for  hours.,1,-1.798894906
M Thompson,Easy to find but very uncomfortable to sit in. Choose between massive armchairs that are far too big or sit at the small tables that are used for eating on rock hard dining chairs. Good range of drinks on offer but limited snacks. Only  minutes Wifi free any more you pay for.,3,-0.232618709
R Gordon,Busy but not over-full. I arrived for some lunch snacks before  Marrakech departure. I'm vegetarian so it would be appreciated if the sandwiches could be labelled. Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine. Gate  appeared and I wasn't sure if I had to walk all the way over that irritating airbridge which adds another  minutes to your journey.,4,0.550519389
M Kenworthy,Appalling lounge. Probably the one of the worst Business Class lounge I have used. ignorant staff at the entrance desk to the lounge. Plus points - a big lounge? The food was crisps or cheese and crackers. Thatâ€™s it. I did use the showers and although the shower room was big it could have done with modernising. There is no self service drinks area only a staffed bar which was a typical American type bar with all the seats taken and no room to place an order. Had to lift the drinks over peoples heads. Again the bar staff were quite rude and surly and God help you if you order more than  drinks! This airport falls way way below any decent European airport. After a great holiday in New York this airport really did let the city down.,2,-1.015756808
A Thorne,A substandard lounge. Most importantly for me the lounge only provides access to the Free Terminal Internet rather than a dedicated service. This service does not allow access to corporate networks so I could not synchronize my email before the flight. Further the service was so slow I could not even access my personal Gmail. I left my hotel this morning anticipating that I would pick up breakfast in the lounge. The breakfast options were Crisps and a dry biscuit bread - below expectation and below the competitive benchmark. The only newspapers available were a Jewish / Israeli weekly in English and only other Hebrew and Middle Eastern publications. Nothing in English German or Dutch. It was peak hour yet half the lounge was closed off creating a shortage of seating. For tea there was no milk available just powdered creamer. There was one hot food facility available. it was empty and appeared to be out of use. The general conditions and atmosphere in the Lounge were far below the pre flight experience offered by competitors.,2,-1.015756808
Chris Ford,Spacious clean and quiet this lounge offered the standard beverage selection by American standards (ie. the worst in the developed world) and some decent snacks on offer. Along with bagels and bread that you can toast yourself with spreads there were also various other nibbles available. Free wifi and newspapers but no flight announcements. It was a good experience overall but it was after I had to endure a couple of United Red Carpet Clubs on the trip!,3,-0.232618709
S Albury,This lounge has a very limited range of food and drink but this would be just about acceptable if there was somewhere to escape the relentless sax led funk background music. Dreadful.,3,-0.232618709
Les Young,We had a two hour wait in the lounge and found it to be very comfortable and the complimentary hot and cold food was excellent. There was a complimentary bar as well. Free Wi-Fi and special areas for viewing TV programs and also working areas with desktop computers.,5,1.333657488
Tony McLaughlin,Much improved from my last visit  years ago. WiFi is available the bathrooms are in the lounge. It is air conditioned. It is bigger. Good selection of drinks although you have to ask the desk to replenish. Snacks only. Very good for a regional airport.,3,-0.232618709
K McDonald,Twice have had to fight to get in despite having a clear reservation paid for by my company. Eventually they begrudgingly let me in. The way they speak to people is loud and embarrassing it really is time Continental taught these desk staff that customer service should not be discourteous or humiliating. Lounge was scruffy and with unhelpful staff. The only food was little packs of crackers and cheese and apples. Hot drinks available but soft drinks had to be collected at the bar. As I was on a long haul international flight I expected that a better selection of food would be available. cI have not bothered with the lounge since prefering the airport shops and restaurants.,2,-1.015756808
S Madan,Spacious lounge but very overcrowded when I used it. Lounge chairs were comfortable but it was a mission to find an empty one. No problems in terms of cleanliness,,
Chris Priester,The lounge in Sao Paulo is a welcomed retreat from the rest of this very hectic airport. It has plenty of seating and is clean the wifi can be hit/miss but generally is acceptable. They could use a few more televisions as they only have  but just being out of the main terminal is a great benefit. They provide finger food soup bread and cheese nothing really spectacular but as mentioned better than the rest of the terminal.,3,-0.232618709
Roger Tilling,The last time I visited the LGW BA Terraces lounge it was on two floors - now there is only one. Entry was fast and there is a good selection of food and drinks on offer. It was about midday and there was a full and extensive salad buffet with cold cuts. There was also a selection of sandwiches. The wide drinks selection is there. But the sheer volume of passengers makes it like a January sale. BA has removed a number of flights from Gatwick and moved them to Heathrow and halved the floor space of its lounge as a result. However the remaining floor space isn't enough for the flights still operating from Gatwick. So expect crowds empty food trays no drink glasses and occupied showers. Rest assured that the sandwiches will never be stale - they are never available long enough to get that way.,3,-0.232618709
D Burrows,"Superb level of service - attentive and friendly without being ""over the top"". Excellent range of wine and other drinks. Very good food. Calm and relaxed atmosphere. Excellent washroom facilities.",5,1.333657488
T McLaughlin,Much better than the North Lounge. Ample breakfast food. Comfortable and serene. Recommended.,5,1.333657488
Patrick Jordan,My wife and I were flying Newark to Orlando in First Class and are both Continental OnePass Gold Elite card holders. We were refused access to the lounge because Gold cards only grant access on international routes. Refusal was quite abrupt so I asked to speak to a supervisor. He explained Continentals' lounge policy and apologised for it's complexity. He went on to ask if I had any other Star Alliance cards - a Diamond Club Gold card holder was sufficient to gain access - another airline's card is more beneficial than Continental's. The lounge is very big bright and nicely furnished with superb view of the apron. Not a huge range of food or beverages but complimentary wi-fi. Showers and restrooms in the lounge. A relaxing place to while away time but be sure to do the homework before arriving at the desk.,3,-0.232618709
D Mauro,Spacious with good light and decent reading material but minimal and cheesy food offerings. Unfortunately the staff tend to be rude and unhelpful. They never want to let me in even though I always qualify for entry with my elite status. This treatment defeats the purpose of holding elite status and being recognized as a valued customer. After arguing for entry I always have high expectations for the place and it never seems to live up. If it's crowded inside you'd probably be better off walking around Terminal C and shopping or people- watching.,3,-0.232618709
D Kelly,Large lounge in terminal E that is new and generally has lots of room. I have been there in the mornings and it can be packed. This time was midday for a flight to Mexico about half full and plenty of space. It has nice views of the gates and taxi ways has showers (I have not used them) open bar that is staffed and snacks.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,Decent food on offer cheese cakes a curry mushroom soup and some thai titbits that were very tasty. Reasonable wine choice mainly Australian including sparkling wine rather than champagne. Staff were very efficient at clearing plates. There appeared to be plenty of showers although I didn't need to use them. The only negative was painfully slow WiFi I gave up trying. I also tried to JAL lounge it was more spacious but BA had better drink and marginally better food.,3,-0.232618709
Nadia Ridout-Jamieson,Ridiculously busy dirty and poor food. How did BA ever sink so much? The North lounge at Heathrow is now beyond the pale and the south lounge is not much better. It is not a pleasant experience and compares unfavourably to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow by some distance. It's hard to find any privacy in these lounges. The food at best is of average quality and I am unsurprised to read that the Food Standards Agency has ordered improvements in basic hygiene levels in these lounges. I'm afraid I too myself off to the Eat cafe for coffee. I felt the Â£. I paid there was better value and certainly the coffee was better. Shame on you BA. For the prices you charge you should treat your Club class passengers with more respect.,3,-0.232618709
Frederick Coleman,I have used this lounge many times and it is the best compared to other Continental lounges. Good seating showers and work centers. Snacks are light but all right. Drinks are free which is nice. All in all a good lounge.,4,0.550519389
A Pontes,Despite flying st class on a trip around the world ticket I was initially denied access. Paid $ to get in. Domestic flight passengers are excluded only members of Continental FF. Though Internet facilities are available no computers are available. Food nothing to write home about. The lounge is spacious.,3,-0.232618709
M Ackermans,This is the worst lounge that I have been in. Breakfast only sweet biscuits sweet croissants some sandwiches - early in the morning and once the food is gone it is gone. So do yourself a favour and do not come to the Le Anfore lounge as it is not worth the trouble. I would hate to think what they charged Qantas for the orange juice and the coffee we had.,3,-0.232618709
Robert Donnelly,"Overall a disappointment even with a discount. Because time blocks are sold based upon your departure time we were obliged to ""buy"" -hours of access when we only needed two. On the plus side the lounge is calm airy comfortable and has great views of the tarmac. On the other hand staff were indifferent and insufficiently aware of the needs of the ""buffet"" station. The food itself was barely okay. Selection and quality were narrow. The ""hot"" dishes most certainly were not and I worried about that. Wine selection was also okay. House selection(s) were Canadian brands. Was it worth $CAD+? No.",3,-0.232618709
A York,Poor wifi lazy staff and pokey lounge. Front desk ran out of buffet tickets for business class diners and just generally feels badly organized. I did a speed test on the wi-fi and it was < mb/s. lounge is shared with AA but really can't accommodate many people at all. Some nice armchairs in first area but otherwise cramped and uncomfortable. I fly out out here often and it's just not good enough for BA.,2,-1.015756808
S Reiziger,I have been in this lounge before when I used mileage to upgrade to Business class. The lounge is spacious with plenty of drinks but not much food offered except cheese crackers and chips. It has free internet connection. This trip I got an Elite upgrade and thought I could use the lounge. Yes I could but my spouse who also was an Elite passenger waiting for an upgrade was not allowed to accompany me. A rude receptionist insisted that it was Continental Airlines policy concerning passengers flying to Caribbean and South America! I placed a call to Continental One Pass to find down if that was really the case and got no coherent answer. Two hours later my spouse got upgraded but it was too late to go in the place!,2,-1.015756808
Jeff Lemon,"This is a small but comfortable lounge that has good views of the ramp and aircraft departing. Snack choices limited and food purchased out in the concourse is not allowed. Probably the best feature is the bar as the complimentary Bloody Marys are excellent and service is great. Premium wine is also available for purchase although the prices can be steep. On this visit we noted that ""Opus One"" super premium red wine was $. a glass! Due to its size the lounge can get a bit crowded at times
Eugene West,How pathetic! True embarassment for Continental - no real food $ """"premium"""" drinks and sloppy and disaffected help. Really an incredibly poor lounge in this """"flagship"""" terminal C at Newark. You will be better off just walking about the terminal and visiting shops.""",2,-1.015756808
James Myers,I visited this lounge at the end of a wonderful trip to the Niagara Falls area for a family reunion flying in and out of Toronto from London. Part of the enjoyment was travelling in business class (Club World) and on the return trip I had several hours to enjoy the Lounge before the night flight. What made it special for me was the very kind and attentive manager Tony (I don't have his surname). And it wasn't just Tony as all the staff were very nice and welcoming. They are good ambassadors for BA!,5,1.333657488
D West,Thought we'd try the lounge as it was yards away from departure gate. What a pleasant surprise. Quiet and peaceful and away from the crowds in the mail lounge. I think it's even better than First!,4,0.550519389
A Simon,I found this lounge great for relaxing and unwinding as only British Airways first class passengers are allowed in. Unless you have your  frequent flier tier points to get a Concorde Room Card all gold and silver card holders use the galleries lounges meaning this one is much more quiet and peaceful. Staff did a good job keeping the lounge clean but sometimes this meant that they took a bit too much time to fulfill passenger's requests. Although they definetly did not outdo themselves in terms of the restroom/shower quality they did a good job with it and I found each well kept. Business center had pretty fast Internet and wifi worked well. Although the food options offered were all very tasty one thing I disliked about this lounge was that those options were pretty limited and other than a few main course choices there were only light snacks available upon request. Overall I think Britsh Airways took a good risk by not making this lounge extremely large and instea d putting their focus on the quality of the area and I would definetly visit again and recommend it to others.,5,1.333657488
Clive Drake,"The ""Official"" Continental lounge in Newark was very disappointing on the outbound - so it was with some misgivings that we rested up in their shared lounge in Lima Peru. We need not have worried - it was bordering on very good. Free drinks including spirits reasonable selection of tasty snacks and food decent well spaced seats TVs and business center. The only annoying factor was a lounge representative yelling (literally!) from the center of the floor in annoying Spanish - flight details and boarding information. Overall though a good experience.",4,0.550519389
Jason Choi,This was my first time visiting this Lounge. This will probably be my last. I have experienced other airline/airport lounges before and this one is disappointing. I bought a day pass ($) and decide to see whether it is really worth it. The lounge is circular and very spacious. However there is only  snack bar in the entire lounge. Therefore if you were sitting on the other side of the lounge you had to get up and walk all the way around to get to the snack bar.,4,0.550519389
A Simon,The only downside to this lounge is that it doesn't open until pm for the evening flights (I am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of JFK) so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the Galleries First and Terraces Lounges which are nice but don't touch the quality of this lounge. A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also  computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad. Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.,5,1.333657488
P Donald,The aesthetics of the lounge are very pleasing the food and service levels are dismal. Food is served under hot lamps but unfortunately they don't do their work food is cold. Attempting to speak to staff made no difference. British Airways are expensive customers who part with well earned cash deserve an above average experience. This wasn't average it was dismal.,2,-1.015756808
N White,Very poor. The quality and choice of the food has gone downhill. They must be on an economy drive or changed supplier as the difference has been very noticeable. BA are falling behind in the premium class. I'm writing this in the lounge on the world's slowest Internet connection too!,3,-0.232618709
Paul Vernall,Holideck lounge is three level lounge shared by many airlines. It is operated by KLM and is located past security in Terminal . The lounge covers three levels and has good views of the runway and taxiway. There are no washrooms or showers in the lounge and limited internet facilities. There are two bars both of which were unattended. Passengers just went behind the bar and helped themselves to a drink. Snacks were limited to chips packaged cheese and some cookies. Very basic and low in quality. The only plus side is the ability to escape the turmoil of Heathrow and have a peaceful drink.,1,-1.798894906
W Robert Kmen,"Tocumen Airport in Panama is not particularly large, but it sprawls out over a good distance. The Copa Club is centrally located, but it is very difficult to find. The entrance is relatively small and nondescript. There is no signage to help confused passengers, and the directions given by airport employees only made matters worse. I am a retired Spanish teacher, so this wasn't a language problem. A few well-placed signs would solve this problem easily. Once the club is found, it becomes obvious that their template for airport lounges comes from the United Club. The food and drink choices are a mirror image of United's with one exception - quality alcoholic beverages are free. I would recommend the airline but not the lounge.",5,1.333657488
K Hyde,Comfortable and attractive enough but a rather crowded lounge which is difficult to locate. Ground staff are not very helpful and lounge staff not very welcoming. Very little food and limited drinks available. Not a bad place but these and other customer service issues as well as limited facilities and food make this a very basic lounge that will not be remembered well by any visitor. No one would look forward to a second visit.,3,-0.232618709
David Carter,First time flying in First through T and huge disappointment with the Concorde Lounge - no dedicated security checks means you stand in a queue for  minutes. Lounge is small and cramped - staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair. Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business. Overall don't use this lounge and T as any kind of reason to fly British Airways!,2,-1.015756808
Alan Wan,Having visited the BA First lounges at JFK and LGW and being disappointed I was very surprised how good the lounge was. Lots of space and natural light and good food and drink choice. The Mrs and I had made to order food as well as helping ourselves to the hot buffet and cakes we felt very spoilt. Nice champagne only let down was the Johnny Walker Blue available at LGW was missing.,4,0.550519389
B Wijesinghe,"May  afternoon and evening usage due to a long layover. The lounge space is quite nice and functions reasonably well despite lacking shower facilities. The glass tube shaped terminal building offers nice tarmac views from this lounge. The food service is merely average most of the day but the beverage service is quite good. A dinner buffet was served much too late for the ""Sleeper Service"" flight. BA does this to exclude the CX customers who share the lounge but it gives BA passengers only about an hour prior to boarding leaving very little time for flexibility. Lounge front counter staff members were outstanding and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Overall one of the nicer BA lounges though not quite as well equipped as their lounges at LHR T.",4,0.550519389
I Johnstone,Very small lounge for the size of airport and became very busy toward departure time of mid afternoon flight. Very attentive reception staff. Food on offer at approximately  hrs was fine (sandwich selection pastries soup biscuits crisps nuts etc). Lounge staff cleared and cleaned up efficiently. This lounge just needs to be extended as it is too small. Close to gates  + for the LHR flights and boarding calls made timely.,4,0.550519389
D Salter,Good welcome. Despite being busy plenty of seating - either for sitting at table to eat or just sitting. Great selection of food which was frequently refreshed. Clear up service of used plates and mugs somewhat slow. Great viewing of planes landing. Toilet facilities clean and sufficient.,5,1.333657488
Pat Marwick,Very disappointed in the Concorde Room. The dining staff seemed almost irritated that we wanted breakfast. Scrambled eggs were cold. I'm still waiting for the second cup of coffee I requested. Very pleasant seating outside in the terrace area but so difficult to catch the attention of the staff. I eventually went up to the bar myself but the one guy was busy filling orders for the waitresses and I had to wait to catch his attention. I saw no food except for the food served in the dining area. Next time we will go to the Galleries Lounge and help ourselves.,4,0.550519389
J Rodder,The BA lounge at Warsaw airport is located after Immigration control on the lower level. A fairly quiet lounge with hot and cold drinks available but a poor selection of snacks. Crisps and nuts seem to make up BA's choice of food in Warsaw although a few stale bread rolls were available with cheese. The lounge offers a basic product.,3,-0.232618709
J Henson,Late morning flight to Heathrow. I found the lounge relatively easily. Warm welcome limited flight information in the lounge but flight was called in plenty of time ( minutes prior) and boarding had only just started when we arrived. Travelling to the gate (G) involved using a shuttle/train so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time. Lounge very spacious. Newspapers available but no English language magazines. Food limited but - too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. Catering consisted of crisps nuts fruit and a few pastries. Coffee machine broken. Beer on tap but another passenger commented that the barrel needed to be changed. Plenty of alcohol available including prosecco. Luggage storage space available. Toilets decent and within lounge.,3,-0.232618709
J Henson,Mid morning flight to Rome a reasonably warm welcome at the front desk. Decent selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge was very busy and it was a struggle to find  seats in particular ones surrounded by used glasses plates and cups. Wi-fi was difficult to connect to although more the fault of myself and my iPad. Password readily displayed and there is a a guide in the lounge for iPad users. Champagne available on request and (unusually) freely available in the bar area. Selection of basic breakfast items juices and snacks. There is very limited hot food available in this lounge. Toilets very clean.,3,-0.232618709
Christopher Slater-Walker,"We had some difficulty finding this lounge
H Pugh,The lounge is a bit tired and Wi-Fi access is via a password at the reception area. In terms of refreshments the lounge has to be the worst I have ever experienced. Snacks were just about it and they were few and far between. There was a large basket of biscuit for cheese but no cheese on offer. When I enquired about this at reception I was curtly told â€œwe offer sandwiches from pm. That's it!â€ I entered the lounge at :pm. Some beer spirits and wine were available but not a great selection. There are no toilets in the lounge so to go you have to take everything with you and it's a trek!,2,-1.0157568077217367
B Johnston,What a disappointment. Canteen style food. Food served in metal canteen holders were a fitting receptacle for clumps of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Cheese served in the same metal container chunks of cheddar and indifferent blue. No wonder the majority were feasting on Kettle Chips as the only fresh oasis in a sea of processed food. We were tempted to slip next door to the One where we knew we could order a fresh cooked snack before boarding but instead we are hopeful that the food on board may be better and therefore we will maintain our appetites. Shame on BA for not show casing the Best of British fare when passengers are leaving the UK.,3,-0.23261870920862976
A Twigg,Not very well signposted to the location of the lounge I just happened to look left at the correct time! Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible. Overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the UK. Much larger than required but not going to complain! Food on offer left me content and drinks on offer were of expected quality.,4,0.5505193893044773
Michael Miller,Visited this lounge on a late Monday afternoon. There were very few people in the lounge when we arrived so no problems finding a comfortable seat. The choice of food was very limited and the same as every time we use this lounge The only hot option was soup which although very good surely should not be the only choice in the middle of winter. Other options were salads cold pasta dish and sandwiches (which were beginning to curl at the edges!) The drinks available were as usual excellent with good wines good choice of spirits and non alcoholic beverages The staff were helpful and friendly. The only thing that lets this premium lounge down is the uninspired food choice.,5,1.3336574878175844
Chris White,There's almost nothing after customs except the BA Lounge. Great range of drinks and wines. Cheese and biscuits and a small range of sandwiches and wraps. No outside windows and quite small. Warm welcome. Comfortable seating.,4,0.5505193893044773
Roger Tilling,It's a trip up a few escalators at the end of the Terminal  departure lounge. Once you are finally there it is a quiet and spacious haven with varous zones - you can use the internet relax on a sofa or at a table. There are various points for coffee and tea wines and spirits as well as a nice food area. For me it was morning and there was a selection of bacon rolls other hot breakfast items yoghurt sliced fresh fruits and juices. The washrooms were clean and shower facilites were also available. There is a similar lounge close to security but that is planned mainly for domestic/european passengers. The one at the far end of T is better.,4,0.5505193893044773
J Henson,Visited the BA Lounge Galleries South lounge in TA prior to a long haul flight to Asia. Very welcoming staff on the front desk. Good selection of newspapers and magazines available. Decent wi-fi which permitted streaming. The cinema area is a good place to relax. Basic but filling selection of hot food available including cous cous pasta and jacket potatoes with various fillings. Good selection of wines available. Attentive staff seemed to be working in the lounge and lounge was kept clean and tidy. Only minor criticism is that on my several recent visits to this lounge it has been very busy or seemingly near capacity with trouble getting a seat anywhere near the buffet area or the sofa area that overlooks the main concourse and the coffee is of vending machine standard. Otherwise this is a very good facility.,5,1.3336574878175844
Derek Salter,Easy to find. Pleasant welcome. Comfortable seating and good view of airport. Varied and tasteful food. Direct access from the lounge to the plane. Just what a lounge should be.,5,1.3336574878175844
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Arrived at about am and the bacon and rolls were thankfully still available. Crowded when we first went in the lounge cleared toward midday. Bacon et al replaced by pastries and fruit.,4,0.5505193893044773
Keith Williams,A spacious comfortable lounge but the selection of food available is no where near as good as that available in LHR T. However much better than most US airport lounges.,4,0.5505193893044773
K Tunnicliffe,Compared to other BA lounges in the UK and abroad this one really sucks. The location is good as the lounge is circular overlooking the main airside lounge and with runway views. The seating was tired and food was almost non existant. We had a midmorning transatlantic flight with American (booked through BA) and there was no evidence of the bacon rolls and other delights we are used to in Terminal . Toilets were in poor condition and the staff were lacklustre to say the least.,2,-1.0157568077217367
A Hickling,Used the Concorde Room in the run up to the Olympics and the height of the school holidays but it wasn't over crowded. I booked a cabana which has a day bed tv free telephone writing desk bathroom and the option to order room service. The staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers and were delivered efficiently and with a smile. The lounge was also cleared of any glasses plates etc and was kept very tidy. The spa treatment was also very good but you need to book in advance to be sure of a treatment. The food choices were excellent for both lunch and dinner accompanied by a selection of vintage champagnes and fine wines.,5,1.3336574878175844
S Lawrie,Great breakfast excellent service. However no massage slots available and sneered at for not booking in advance although never received any information or suggestion to do so. Was never required on previous flights to/from NY. Was spoken to as though I was a complete idiot for not booking before arriving and this was  hours before my flight.,4,0.5505193893044773
S Lawrie,Very small with no privacy. Close to gate so you can sit and watch plane being loaded. Poor selection of food and drink. Some strange sandwich fillings so ended up with a bag of crisps. WI-fi very slow. Toilets only had  cubicles to share with club lounge. Disappointing.,3,-0.23261870920862976
A Machukwa,Lounge in terminal  is more comfortable compared to the one in terminal . Terminal  lounge offers a variety of newspapers alcohol drinks and the interior is just well tailored with a great view and good service.,4,0.5505193893044773
David Bielli,Good lounge adequate in food choices drinks comfortable. Great views of the runways. Good internet facilities newspapers. Overall very pleasant just like the airport - highly recommend and much better than fellow lounges by Delta at JFK/ATL/LAX which I often go to as well.,4,0.5505193893044773
T McLaughlin,Bright airy great views. Quite busy for . on Sunday morning but I guess there were a lot of passengers having arrived fro the US Far East and Australia. Lots of seating and quite varied seating from armchairs to bar stools. Staff exceptionally friendly. Food OK but plentiful. Could do with a few more sockets for charging iPhones etc. Overall a very good experience.,4,0.5505193893044773
T McLaughlin,Pleasant enough lounge. Separate area for those who want to watch TV. Not a great selection of drinks food adequate. Plenty of power points. You don't get blinded by the sun in this lounge as you do in other areas of the airport including the walk to the lounge from Security.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Alan Wan,The First Class lounge looks attractive and seemed classier than the Club lounge next door. The choice of drinks was reasonable with decent champagne but the quality of whiskey was rather low for a First class lounge. I used the showers in the Business Class lounge next door it was okay but I have certainly had better experiences. The real serious disappointment was the choice of food there were some cold sandwiches and packets of cheap cheese and a variety of crisps etc but nothing hot - a real let down.,3,-0.23261870920862976
David Gordon,Regular user of the two Czech airlines business/gold card lounges in Prague. The old lounge (terminal ) is well placed with an excellent view of the apron and pleasant (albeit slightly zany) decor. The new Schengen area lounge (Terminal ) is more functional in its decor and was placed by some stupid designer in a position with no view at all and little natural light. A little imagination and it could have been much better. Charming attendants in both lounges adequate food good drinks and good internet. Makes it worth maintaining the Czech airlines gold card.,4,0.5505193893044773
Derek Greenaway,There appear to be two lounges at Prague. The Crystal and another The Citigold which is supposed to be the better option. Considering the rest of the Airport which is spacious clean and serviceable the lounges were quite frankly awful. We had travelled BA Club Europe and were given passes to the Crystal Lounge. This offered a coffee machine and some nuts and limited seating. We then tried the Citigold as we have gold cards and this was not a lot better. They offered a fridge with some rather dry rolls and an assortment of cold salad pasta in individual pots. A plate of broken biscuits and solf drinks. The carpets looked pretty filthy and I was quite glad to get out of there Free wi-fi was available but we would probably have been better down at KFC in the main hall.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Jim Reid,An excellent lounge plenty space comfortable and with good food. Significantly better than some of the lounges in T.,5,1.3336574878175844
M Clarke,Design is good plenty of different areas and types of seating excellent selection of beverages and good selection of food although not outstanding. Staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave and are very helpful. A very comfortable experience overall - could possibly be improved by an area for sleeping.,5,1.3336574878175844
A Hickling,I spent about  hours in the lounge complex at Heathrow T and was impressed about the constant changes of food throughout the day. I used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus. The north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk. The lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use. If you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request. Shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean. Wifi is free and plenty of computers to use. A most enjoyable way to start a trip.,5,1.3336574878175844
J Wyatt,In the North wing of T. It is huge although on a Sunday morning plenty of the seat were occupied. Usual fare - nosh a bit ordinary. Seat so-so on comfort. All a bit so so really.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Kevin Tunnicliffe,I was travelling on the daily BA flight to London we hit the lounge fairly early and there was nothing much to show in the way of snacks etc. In a conspiratorial voice we were told to tell the bar staff that we were flying with BA and so would not be charged for drinks and so forth (the prices for AA Passengers were ridiculous). We were also told that """"hot food"""" would be available when the last AA flight departed. This proved to be soup and a tray of sandwiches some crudities and a dip. Seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful. Good views of the runway and ramps from the bar area. There were no showers and the bathrooms were not very modern and the fittings were in need of a makeover.""",3,-0.232618709
J Kearney,This is a rabbit warren to get around in. Reasonable to navigate around if you have a sense of direction and you can get your bearings. Good food and beverage range with attentive staff. Definitely no comparison to Qantas First Lounge at Sydney International but I imagine there aren't too many that would.,4,0.550519389
J Kearney,"When you present your First Class Boarding Passes to the First Reception Desk and are told ""you need to go over there"" (Club World Lounge) and you have to point out that you are a First Class passenger things do not bode well. The Lounge is okay but Champagne Bar doesn't keep the champagne chilled adequately. First Class dining room has quite a limited menu and isn't great.  months ago when I travelled First Class out of London we were invited to experience the dining room and presented an invitation to dine after a certain time. This practice has now gone - pity. In fact the hot self serve buffet had a better food choice than the dining area. Overall the First Class Lounge was okay but not great.",4,0.550519389
J Kearney,We arrived at the Lounge to be greeted by  friendly staff and encouraged to enter and relax. When we entered there were the best part of  people in it. We struggled to get the last two seats. We found out that they had closed the Business Class Lounge and put everyone into the First Class Lounge just to make us feel special I guess. Uncomfortable seating self serve basic buffet poor food and beverage to say the least. When we encountered a delay the staff were hopeless. Either inexperienced or incorrectly trained they could not cope or handle high yield passengers appropriately or properly. Choose another airport to transit with a better First Class Lounge.,2,-1.015756808
J Kearney,This is probably the best Business Class Lounge that I have experienced. Bright refreshing and well equipped. Spacious and well fitted out. Enjoyable.,4,0.550519389
R Moore,Excellent lounge with plenty of everything. Used it twice recently and it was quiet well-stocked with drinks food and papers and with plenty of room. Highly recommended.,5,1.333657488
N Werner,British Airways share the Qantas lounge located near the gates which is nice. Welcome was friendly and staff attentive. Food selection is much better than in LHR and nice interesting choices. Lounge is quite spacious even though both BA flights and a Qantas flight were leaving at the same time. There are no views as the lounge is not near the windows of the airport. Showers are nice great water pressure and they use nice toiletries. Staff friendly and gave a small amenity kit. WiFi was strong and quick and the lounge was a serene place to relax.,5,1.333657488
A Hickling,A quiet and relaxed lounge with comfortable seating and superb views of the runways. There are facilities to leave bags and coats and private dining booths for breakfast and lunch. Food and drink is waiter service. Although afternoon tea does not feature on any menu the staff were more than happy to serve this for me. I used one of the cabanas where you have a day bed desk TV phone for free use and luxury bathroom facilities. You can order room service from your cabana. The Elemis Spa is located just outside the lounge but book a treatment early to avoid disappointment. For me using this lounge is part of my holiday before a long haul flight.,5,1.333657488
Bill Atkins,This was an exceptionally nice lounge albeit small for  flights departing close together. For the next year plus it is also to serve as the Admiral's Club for AA Needless to say it has gone from a little haven of peace to a typical US lounge facility. British Airways passengers and the staff clearly hate the situation.,4,0.550519389
Kevin Tunnicliffe,This lounge shared between BA Iberia and American was spacious but laid out in a series of small rooms with a variety of seating options. On the day we were there it was not overcrowded. A good selection of drinks available the attended counter being closed. Food was pretty poor with only a few stale looking croissant sandwiches and soup on offer. The flight announcements were barely audible where we were seated and I had to go and check with the reception that it had indeed been our flight which had been called. Wi-fi and computer availability were good. Unfortunately the arrivals and departure screens only dealt with AA flights.,4,0.550519389
B Wijesinghe,Spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas. The selection of food and beverage is excellent though service when ordering from the menu is slow. Many computer terminals and helpful staff at the inner Customer Service desk. The decorative glass screens between seating areas are lovely when lit if dark outside. The lounge location benefits from nice views of the tarmac and taxiways. The showers and Elemis Health Spa are located outside the lounge and shared with the Galleries Business Class Lounge that is located above.,4,0.550519389
J Samuels,Without a doubt the most miserable business lounge on this planet. Having travelled from London and using the fantastic BA lounge I had the misfortune to land in LA and through a reciprocal arrangement with BA I used the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge. It's a joke - you pay for almost everything the only free stuff consists of things like lukewarm and stewed instant coffee stale biscuits and a few bruised pieces of fruit. You get one drink voucher and no wifi access unless you are a member. Suggest you give this place and American Airlines a wide berth! Unfortunately my next leg is with American Airlines and no surprises you have to pay for in flight coffee and food! I will never fly with budget airline American Airlines again!,1,-1.798894906
R Beagley,I was frankly very disappointed. Only half of the food on the bar menu was available and someone did tell me about other food options that were apparently available but they mumbled so much I have no clue as to what they said - at the third time of asking I gave up.,3,-0.232618709
C Adams,At the bag drop in Terminal  the British Airways staff member let me know that the Galleries North lounge would be much closer to my flight's departure gate than the South lounge. I had not used the North lounge before and went along there assuming it would be the same as the South lounge. In fact it was much less enjoyable. The North lounge is significantly smaller and was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken. It was noisy hot and felt congested with passenger's carry-on bags filling the walkspace. The food selection was similar to the South lounge but the range of magazines available was very limited. Next time I will know to go straight to the South lounge whichever gate my flight leaves from and just leave the extra time to walk up to the gates at the north of the terminal.,3,-0.232618709
Ian Ford,Fairly large lounge visited on a Sunday evening. Standard Terraces comfortable recently updated free wi-fi. The staff are friendly and efficient at clearing tables and ensuring the limited offerings are kept up to date. Only one red and one white wine small selection of spirits and the food is only light snacks but what there is is of a good quality nice tartlets mini sandwiches etc). Overall a good experience it is a nice place to wait for a flight.,4,0.550519389
A Hickling,This is a newly refurbished lounge modelled on the Concorde Room at LHR. Very comfortable and plenty of space as this lounge is for exclusive use of BA passengers only travelling in First. The food and beverages were of high quality and a dining area if you wished to use it. The wifi was a bit slow so gave up in the end. The spa facilities are upstairs in the Terraces lounge and so are shower facilities.,4,0.550519389
A Hickling,A great lounge with plenty of high quality and comfortable seating. The dining options are extensive and there is also an extensive range of drinks to choose from. The private cabanas are good to use as you have more seclusion from the rest of the lounge and have your own bathroom day bed TV writing desk and you can order room service too. There is also a telephone in the room where you can phone for free anywhere in the world. The Boardroom has free computers and a printer and the seats are original Concorde chairs. There are secure storage facilities for your belongings and clean bathroom facilities.,5,1.333657488
Greg Bell,The only hot food available were plastic containers of Two-Minute Noodles. Alcohol is served from a bar which is not always tended - you have to ring a bell and wait. The only other food is packets of crisps crackers cheese. The windows are blocked off by translucent blinds making it rather claustrophobic.,3,-0.232618709
Bill Atkins,The Concorde Room really has lost its exclusive feel. It was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in First - it is supposed to be only for First passengers according to the BA hype. The staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers. Staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available self-service. Food service was O.K. but not very professional and the presentation on the plate would be fine for a transport caff. The whole deal falls short of what one expects of true first class service but of course that is typical of the whole experience on BA.,3,-0.232618709
Jezrel Sabaduquia,"SkyClub in Seattle was bright and spacious with clean well stocked bathrooms. Seating comfortable with excellent views of the apron. Front desk staff helpful and friendly. Food and beverage options are a lot better than United and American with some tasty soup, salad, bread and your usual snack options. My only gripe is the fact that they had disposable plates and utensils which is not classy at all. Service was decent, lounge staff were a bit timid for some reason. WiFi connection was fast which is always great. Overall, a decent lounge and DL definitely leads among the major US legacies when it comes to lounge food.",6,2.116795586
A Gibson,The Sydney Qantas First Lounge could quite possibly be the best first class lounge on the planet. Great menu premium restaurant style food cooked to order and service excellent. Drink menu and the spa are something else. If your into aviation and like seeing the air field activity and the planes coming and going the view is spectacular. Staff very attentive and the meals papers and Internet service excellent. I've travelled a bit First class and this lounge is the new standard. Five star comfort. Didn't really want to get on the plane.,5,1.333657488
A Edmonds,The first class lounge in Houston is pathetic no showers and no food whatsoever except crisps and pre packed biscuits also no champagne. How can they call this First Class I don't know! Business Class lounge is better as they did have a few rather dried up sandwiches.,2,-1.015756808
J Mark,The business class lounge at the new Delta terminal at JFK is very disappointing. Poor layout meager offerings in the way of snacks and/or drinks overcrowded and a very poor set up when wanting to order a paid meal. It's very difficult and unclear as to know how to order food/drinks. Instructions at the tables are vague order placement terminals poorly placed and in general a bewildering experience. The seating is comfortable clean with good choices of seating areas. Lighting is comfortable Rest rooms are clean.,3,-0.232618709
H Thompson,Bought a day pass as this is the only lounge at IND. While rather small it never seems over crowded. It has been kept clean and is an oasis of calm. For a domestic lounge Delta has really stepped up it's game on food offerings with a hot soup green and other salads flat breads and the usual raw veggies and packaged cheeses that used to be it. There is no view and no announcements so you need to keep your wit's about you especially if you are travelling on another airline. A variety of seating but no high tech massage chairs. Overall I was impressed.,4,0.550519389
Kevin Tunnicliffe,"Large pleasantly appointed lounge on two levels with extensive views of the apron and one runway. A two teir bar system operates in the lounge the majority of drinks are free but items from the ""Luxury Bar"" ie. non domestic and premium spirits incur a charge. It was therefore possible to sit and drink Jack Daniels all day but if you wanted named Scotch bacardi and so forth you pay. Draft and bottle beers soft drinks and mixers are all free. We were in the lounge from  to pm and there was plenty of seating available staff were pleasant and efficient. Food was basic
R Lubbers,Not much in the way of sandwiches or snacks on display but there were some cookies and a modest bar selection. The pre-flight dinner in a private dining area (across the hall actually in the Business Lounge) was excellent with a nice salad and well-prepared entree and a choice of excellent dessert. Nice choice of wines as well. The First lounge itself is actually rather small and feels a bit cramped - very pleasant staff however who let us know that our flight was boarding and were apologetic about the half-hour delay.,4,0.5505193893044773
R Lubbers,Huge lounge lots of people but no sense of being crowded. Superb selection of liquor including Grey Goose and other premium brands nice wine selection as well. Fairly extensive selection of snacks of all kinds - some of the sandwiches were superb. Huge area with many computer work stations with good high speed internet service.,5,1.3336574878175844
Gregory Kohll,Lounge operated by Qantas. Quieter than Business Class Lounge but the food selection was disappointing especially compared to Cathay Pacific. Wireless access was provided by the airport and it was difficult to connect. I don't think this lounge matches the standards of the First Class lounges operated by Cathay Pacific and British Airways.,4,0.5505193893044773
Albert Tatyana,The worst SkyTeam lounge I have ever visited. Ridiculously scarce collection of food and drinks. Another disappointing thing is that the personnel in the Santiago lounge did not care about how bad the service and presentation were. I do not even think that they were trained in the customer service. Shame on Delta!,2,-1.0157568077217367
John Hamlin,One word to describe this lounge - horrendous. The lounge is ridiculously small with some people left standing while waiting for seats to become free. The seats themselves are worn and in some cases dirty. Some of the staff were friendly some less so. No hot food and not much cold food either. Delta should be ashamed. While US airline lounges don't compare with those of the European or Asian carriers Delta's Sky Clubs are the worst. My recent experience has shown that Admirals Clubs while not perfect are infinitely superior to Delta's. I like the Delta product in the air but my experience in their clubs has made me seriously consider changing allegiance to American.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Juan Estrada,I travel frequently and this is one of the worse lounges I have been in. At check in the person in charge was on the phone and I had to wait for  minutes. The bar was fine but the bathrooms were appalling. I ended up going to the public bathroom in the terminal. No only the design is bad ( cubicles about  feet tall) but the sinks were dirty the  paper towel machines were empty and there was trash on the floor. Who killed customer service and the glamour of travel?,2,-1.0157568077217367
A Hickling,Although this lounge is modelled on the First Galleries at T it does not live up the service and quality of the Concorde Room. However it is a quieter lounge as the BA flights departing from here leave late in the evening so it's not an issue to book a spa treatment. The menu choices were uninspiring and no afternoon tea served. Pre-flight dining however was much better.,4,0.5505193893044773
Alan Mackenzie,T galleries super for relaxing or working well designed seating areas. Newspapers & magazines in various locations internet computers fax and copiers. Choice of snacks and well stocked bars. The staff are unobtrusive but on hand if you require assistance.,5,1.3336574878175844
Tim Barrs,The lounge was spotless and I was greeted warmly by the man behind the desk even though I wasn't travelling with BA and had entered the lounge via Priority Pass. The toilets were clean bar soft drinks and food was all well stocked and the papers and magazines were all current. There's a TV and a monitor displaying flight times. The man in the lounge was so helpful he even let us know when our non BA flight was boarding!,5,1.3336574878175844
R Pipes,Deplorable. Snacks and sandwiches were days old-the kimchi was rotten they only had Budweiser beer and sweet wines.,2,-1.0157568077217367
D Vayalam,Absolute con- just meant to make money off economy class passengers who are led to believe they are paying for luxury. The worst airline lounge I have ever been to. They charge business class passengers for drinks at the 'luxury bar' at Atlanta and it was the worst Bloody Mary I ever had - always thought they was a safe choice. The seats at Chicago were uncomfortable. The lounges were dirty. I will never take a codeshare flight where Delta is a partner. I am worried that they will now destroy the Virgin lounges considering the fact that they own most of Virgin.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Gilbert Schwartz,This is a contract lounge shared with several airlines including Delta. I was not permitted to invite a guest although I was flying business class and hold a crown Room membership. This is one of the worst international business class lounges - seating is poor - very few tables (I needed to use the floor to place my beverage as there was no table available). Food and drink selection is poor.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Fabrizio Ferraro,I went back to this lounge and was surprised to find that they are transforming the outdated Terraces Lounge into a new Galleries lounge similar to ones at Heathrow airport. The selection of hot food remains poor with only soup available but there was the same selection of cold food and drinks. The lounge was extremely busy but there was enough room.,5,1.3336574878175844
John Beattie,Once passed security there are two lounges. Tip provided to me by the reception was use the lounge by Gate as it has only % occupancy. Took the advice and wandered in to a haven of peace and quiet. The food/drink selection was good. Staff were polite and helpful where required.,5,1.3336574878175844
Tony McLaughlin,Very small lounge but well staffed and stocked. There was no aircon however which made it very uncomfortable on a day when it soared to  celsius. Mobile phones must be switched off. Ricard was the only spirit on offer.,3,-0.23261870920862976
S Koenig,Not a large lounge and with a limited selection of free snacks and drinks (there is also a bar) but clean and quiet. Located in Terminal S from which most (but not all) Delta flights depart. Our flight departed from another terminal so we had to take an elevator down to the terminal level then another (or escalator) down to a train to take us to our terminal.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Elias Baumgarten,JFK Skyclub lounge is so disappointing after experiencing KLM's in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam you get great food snacks: good breads and cheeses croissants etc. At JFK it's basically just drinks and things that go with drinks as if no one wants to eat anything but carrot sticks and olives. I was upgraded on my next flight from JFK to DTW at dinner time and on that flight in FIRST CLASS there was just a basket of junk food of the kind you'd get at a /. Delta seems to think all people want are drinks. I'm Gold Medallion and was glad for the privilege of the Skyclub lounge in Amsterdam (KLM's) but Delta in JFK (and I imagine elsewhere) is much inferior.,3,-0.23261870920862976
S Koenig,First time we used the rather new (remodeled) lounge in the international terminal (F). Large comfortable. Plenty of showers. Outdoor patio appended to the main lounge area was nice. Small but decent selection of free snacks beverages. Clean. Can take some time to get from here to domestic gates but not a big problem.,4,0.5505193893044773
J Leahy,Small but very well set lounge with wine bar and eating area business area in far corner. Staff friendly and flights are called. No signs of cut backs.,4,0.5505193893044773
K Tunnicliffe,This lounge has no windows. It comprises three or four box like rooms including the dining room. The lounge is comfortable and well supplied with drinks and biscuits. The selection of sandwiches was poor two choices plus a wrap of some sort. The pre flight dinner which BA offers for overnight flights to London was cold or lukewarm. Hardly surprising when the chef spent most of his time on the internet in the business section of the lounge instead of in the kitchen! The exception was the excellent sweetcorn chowder of which I had two bowls as the rest of the food was stale and uninviting. Not a patch on the preflight dinner I enjoyed a couple of years ago at JFK. I don't know if this is yet another sign of the diminishing standards with BA or just a lazy chef. No showers either. The rest of the staff were very helpful and gave good service.,3,-0.23261870920862976
E McCaffery,Large and airy lounge with plenty space which is needed at busier times as gets fairly congested! Good selection papers magazines etc. Food readily available and plenty of it! Well cooked too and replenish regularly at busy times. Good selection of alcoholic/non- alcoholic drinks too!,4,0.5505193893044773
Derek Rawlins,As a very frequent flyer my wife and I think that this is the worst lounge we have ever been in. The staff on front desk surly and totally not interested in their customers who pay their wages they need to be reminded food options non existent. Coffee machine broken not in use . I think Delta need to look around and maybe visit their Atlanta lounge. All in all a very bad advertisement.,1,-1.7988949062348438
David Jordan,This lounge is used by SkyTeam airlines here at Narita and what a poor reflection on SkyTeam as an airline alliance. Why is it that airline lounges operate by US carriers offer such second rate standards with this Delta lounge being cheap overcrowded and very dirty by Japanese standards? The breakfast offering food-wise is quite pitiful some cereals yogurt and low quality pastries - is this what I get when flying First Class with a SkyTeam airline? Washrooms were dirty the showers at best a -Star standard. In other words this is a lounge to avoid if you are used to the higher standards normally found in Asia and Japan. My last trip out of Narita was with ANA and the ANA Suite lounges are so so superior to the poor standards that US airlines such as Delta provide.,2,-1.0157568077217367
A Nishimura,This is a joke lounge it's really like sports bar. I had to pay for everything nothing was free apart from nuts and carrots. I had prosecco and sushi which was very wrong - really hard rise huge sushi.. Came up $. I should have just hang out at the gate as it was so far away to get there couldn't be bother to go back again.,2,-1.0157568077217367
E McCaffery,Worse than any other lounge ever experienced regardless of class of travel! To be fair airport undergoing renovations at time but that did not excuse the poor quality and availability of decent edible food! Poor selection of drinks and lacklustre service. Worst of all the air conditioning was not working and felt like being in a sauna for an hour before flight took off. Avoid like the plague!,2,-1.0157568077217367
E McCaffery,Calm environment in which to relax pre/post flight. Tastefully decorated and plenty of quiet spaces where it is possible to gain some privacy from others. Good cabanas to refresh and catch up on some sleep between flights. Full dining facilities enable one to get maximum sleep on board if overnight flight. Plenty of decent Champagne too! A proper first class facility if only this could be transposed onboard!,5,1.3336574878175844
J Polley,I have spent many hours in the SEA Skyclub the last few months. Recently Delta has been testing new food offerings here including soup cold sandwiches and hot and cold appetizers. The soup and sandwiches are a welcome addition and might quiet some of the criticism in these comments. Other criticisms have been the presence of children in some of the delta clubs. Personally I found the children refreshing and much more interesting than the folk that typically populate the clubs. Delta has solved that problem too as they will soon begin to charge $ per guest including family members unless you purchase a $ executive membership. The SEA club has a great staff especially the bartenders. The complementary alcohol though is poor quality and the Luxury Bar drinks are not cheap. The seating in this club is generally uncomfortable except for the quiet room. This lounge needs additional electric outlets in the seating areas. There is only one shower but usually not a wait for it. Wifi is always good.,4,0.5505193893044773
Alex Lee,Decent quiet reliable lounge. Was able to have a relaxing wait at SeaTac before my recent flight to CDG. Like most US airline lounges the food was basic and unadventurous but there were just enough satisfying items (among them some good soups that I actually had several helpings of). No showers in the bathroom I think but the washrooms were clean.,4,0.5505193893044773
Keith Williams,Large lounge considering the size and throughput of the airport - Druk Air only has two A Airbus and no-one else flies there. Comfortable sofas and easy chairs. Reasonable selection of drinks (although the fridge was not connected) - only a tin of biscuits for snacks. Washroom facilities other side of security so you have to go through but they let you back when you show your Boarding Card!,2,-1.0157568077217367
Ian Henderson,One of a group of lounges in Terminal D all operated by one company but with separate identities and side by side. Pleasant helpful staff and plenty of drinks and nibbles. The concierge announced that new sandwiches had arrived! First lounge is off the Business. Just one male and one female loo and a small business centre. Plenty of newspapers. Compared with the nearby Admiral's Club an oasis of calm and style.,4,0.5505193893044773
Fabrizio Ferraro,This Galleries lounge is very similar to the ones in T although it is much smaller. They have the same choice of food and drinks and similar facilities. It is extremely quite due to the small number of BA flights out of T and the downside is the lack of natural light (the windows are quite narrow) and the lack of atmosphere. Even the BA staff looked bored and not very welcoming.,4,0.5505193893044773
Paul Browne,Very impressive from the welcome at the door to every member of the staff encountered. Lovely ambience with a lot of room to move around. Took lunch in the Dining Room which was the only disappointment.,5,1.3336574878175844
William Scott,Lounge was somewhat of a joke. Interior definitely done on the cheap. Food consisted of crackers and some mystery dip. Room not clean with tables that had not been picked up by employees for some time. Annoying children with parents who think the room is a play ground. My wife and I left after  minutes shaking our heads in disgust. We would rather wait at the gate at this airport.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Kevin Kjelland,No food but crackers and carrots this is terrible I guess we are all to eat like rabbits and drink like fish? They use to be good with hot snacks bread and other finger foods. This frustrating when the cost of the flights went up a lot and the service went way down. This last time my company with book with Delta business class and we are platinum members.,3,-0.23261870920862976
M Thompson,Had to pay  dollars despite having a first class ticket as flight was within USA. All that was provided was cheese and biscuits but could have drunk unlimited booze. Reasonably comfortable and free wifi but became a little crowded as time went and clearing of tables slow. Poorest lounge of all I have been in.,3,-0.23261870920862976
Tim New,The best thing about the BA lounge at Newcastle is the staff. I fly every week so have got to know them and they are always professional and courteous. Lounge a bit old and worn now but donâ€™t expect BA will upgrade (they only seem to be in the business of downgrading everything these days). Good selection of drinks. Sandwiches at lunchtimes nice freshly prepared and a good selection. A nice place to wait for an hour or a bit longer. The staff are the same two or three very pleasant ladies â€“ wish BA would commission them to train their FA colleagues in customer centricity! One negative - just one loo and it has never flushed properly since my two years using it.,3,-0.23261870920862976
E Hochstatter,The lounge in Terminal  at Stockholm-Arlanda is very basic. It is shared with other OneWorld partners and I believe is part of the Priority Pass network. The lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style. There are just medium-sized seats spread out over the lounge. The food was basic and mediocre consisting mainly of cheese and ham bread rolls and what appeared to be a quinoa salad. The standard fizzy drinks on offer. Curiously red and whte wine was available but in a beer-like pouring mechanism. In short there is no need to get to the airport early to enjoy this lounge because there is not much to enjoy unlike other BA lounges.,4,0.5505193893044773
K Warren,Delta management either doesn't visit lounges outside the U.S. or doesn't care how poor the lounges they offer are. Lounges outside the USA have hot food and it's free. Drinks are free. First Class ticket gets you in. Now enter the Delta Lounge's in there home airport Atlanta. Coach snacks and alcohol. Wifi that is slow. Overcrowding. According to staff at ATL the biggest complaint is no hot food like the rest of the world. Now Delta is opting for a $ annual fee for frequent fliers and Diamond travelers will have to pay in one year/January . I'm not sure what Delta is trying to prove with this new scheme. Perhaps to let everyone know that they care more about executive pay and bonuses than the customer. Personally I'm now going to stop my loyalty to Delta and start using other better airlines. Diamond status means nothing anymore.,2,-1.0157568077217367
M Liebmann,It has been expanded and improved. Granted the food choices were still somewhat limited but the choices had increased in number. In addition there are now showers set up.,4,0.5505193893044773
A Evans,Pleasant small lounge with reasonably comfortable seating. Good views of stands and an open area outside originally used for us smokers but now banned. Shame! No hot food but fresh sandwiches and cakes. An adequate selection of drinks. As there is only one flight a day I was surprised there were not more people.,3,-0.23261870920862976
James Wyatt,The door to the lounge is just a few feet from the security check - very convenient. A lot of chairs sofas etc. Good looking bar. Outside space has a good-ish view of planes and side view of runways. WC's were so-so. Booths are brilliant. I had a superb breakfast which was serve piping hot and very quickly. Didn't try the other goodies.,4,0.5505193893044773
R King,Very quiet in the middle of the day - we had  hours to wait between flights with our  year old daughter - an amazing kids room in the lounge with soundproof glass walls. You can sit outside and relax and watch the kids inside. Very good idea! Great selection of French and european wine great nibbles. Only downside - Coffee machine made terrible coffee and the restaurant did not open for the entire  hours we were there (not enough clients??). Still had the snack menu but no sit down fine dining as advertised. At .pm it had still not opened for dinner and after asking and getting no response we left to catch our flight. I am still confused as to what was going on here. Free PCs with internet too.,4,0.5505193893044773
D Neckers,This lounge is a disgrace. The place isn't clean
J Gardner,Crowded noisy uncomfortable poor snack items - but still probably better than being out on the concourse. We tried both Sky Clubs on the B Concourse. We spent most of our time in the lounge near B. The place was packed but we did find two chairs. The place was packed with people many of whom were yapping on their cellphones. A fair number of families some with babies who were shrieking and children who used the lounge like a gym. The snack offerings were minimal some veggies cookies pretzels etc. The espresso machine took too long to dispense a simple cup of regular coffee (no airpots). The bathrooms were a disaster - dirty smelly and as others have mentioned with the cheapest toilet paper.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Andy Barclay,I've been a Delta Diamond flyer for the last year of so which gives me access to the lounge. I have written to complain about the speed of the wifi several times but they haven't done anything to improve it. I am sitting in the lounge right now connected using the access point on my phone.  months ago they did not charge for any of their draft beers. Now only one beer is complementary - and it isn't a good one. All I want is a nice local brew like Booklyn Lager. The complementary cabernet is Sycamore Lane - its not good either. I also tried the Merlot by the same folks. not good. I'm not a cheap guy but I'm a bit annoyed about this change. If I way paying for a business class ticket or paying for louge access I'd really be angry. I have the same comments as one of the previous posters. I'm sitting here in the lounge and there are literally  empty glasses from previous patrons within arms reach. Last week I got off the redeye and tried to come in to use a shower. They said it would be an hour wait. This is completely unacceptable.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Steve Ham,New lounge looks good and is for BA use only. Selection of hot and cold food which was very tasty and well presented. We were on the day flight with using the  so lounge was very quiet. Would presume it would be busy for the evening  flight.,4,0.5505193893044773
J Muga,Lounge is comfortable enough using the same furniture as the new lounges at Heathrow T. The problem is mosquitos that have come in not a few-but a massive amount. The catering is poor old fruitcake stale cheese and a few Indian dishes guaranteed to give stomach problems - nobody touched them! Yet they have four attendants standing around doing nothing - why spend all the money for a new lounge?,2,-1.0157568077217367
J Aberg,This lounge is a rather standard BA lounge but it does have some major flaws. Capacity is a big problem in this lounge. I have rarely been in a lounge of this size where I have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever. The lounge was absolutely packed! It was so full that I decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge. I wanted to go on-line but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge. I paid quite a hefty charge and I had major problems trying to connect. I could only spend five minutes on-line and I was constantly disconnected. In summary there is significant room for improvement!,3,-0.23261870920862976
J Polley,The T SkyClub at JFK is the largest and newest SkyClubs in Delta's system. This lounge has a SkyDeck an open-air observation deck with a great view of the terminal area and runways. There are plenty of outlets for recharging with complimentary wifi. Inside you can order a hot meal or snack at prices that are competitive. This is the only SkyClub where you can get a meal or enjoy usual assortment of light snacks found in all SkyClubs. There is free beer wine and liquor but to get higher quality booze and a wider selection you have to pay. There are six shower rooms. The attendants keep a waiting list which seems to move quickly. Each room comes with amenities. There is a good variety of newspapers. SkyClubs that are in locations formerly run by Northwest Airlines do not have this problem.,5,1.3336574878175844
Brian Smith,This lounge is quite large but it does not have enough seats or space for the numbers of people passing through! There was a line out the door at one point to enter. The toilets inside were the same as the ones outside. The food on offer is the same as all Delta lounges which is limited to some raw vegetables with humus chips pretzels and other cheap snack foods. Drinks are similarly uninspired. They had special Johnny Walker drinks but for $ extra per drink! The seats were stained from overuse. All the passengers were all hooked up to their in-ear phones and speaking loudly to people somewhere else about business making it really loud and strange. The only good thing about the lounge is the fact you get free wifi. As a passenger on an international connection in business class I was allowed to enter. You would have to be insane to pay $ for a day pass to enter this place.,2,-1.0157568077217367
J Polley,The Sky Club at SAN is opened three weeks ago. The terminal also appears to be fairly new
L Haas,I visited one lounge in the main part of T only to see a """"Boarding Now"""" sign for my flight which was not departing for nearly  hours. It turns out they were trying to get people to the TB satellite because of enhanced security procedures. I made my way over to TB and used the lounge there - not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use. All in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight. One negative for BA: when I arrived at Heathrow a week previously - the Arrivals lounge at T had already closed promptly at pm. This seems very early given that the nd schedule SFO-LHR flight arrives at  pm.""",4,0.550519389
Andre Le Quesne,One would have thought that British Airways/Jersey would have taken notice of R Pemberton's review of this lounge -  August . Absolutely nothing has changed - for the better that is. At the time of my visit (late afternoon) dirty crockery was strewn across the tables. The elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when I entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting. It may be that BA Jersey are trying to save on electricity but I could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off. There are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dog-eared newspapers on the shelves. Carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there. I used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day. I live in Jersey and this is my local airport. What sort of impression does this hellhole make on departing passengers?,1,-1.798894906
Clive Drake,The recent experience of the BA Terraces lounge at Gatwick was one of total shock - since my last visit in October. % of the facility has been closed - what was on two floors providing a very good experience - is now an insult to every BA Club World customer - as it is now located on  floor. Passengers cannot find seats (due to overcrowding) - and me and my family of  had to half stand and half sit as we ate our snack breakfast. BA's cost cutting has reached a new and deeply insulting low in the way it treats it's premium customers - thankful I am flying with another airline this month to New Zealand.,2,-1.015756808
B Snober,The Lounge is good nothing much. Snacks only and you can't get food from outside. You can't really find a place to sleep or relax sometimes it's nearly full. Recommended only if you are staying a long time at the airport.,3,-0.232618709
M Boyne,What a disappointment this lounge is. Carrots celery olives cheese & crackers are the free food choices. There is a restaurant in the lounge but we went outside to order. There were dirty dishes throughout the lounge and no one seemed eager to clean up. Thread bare towels that I am not even sure were clean. We spent good money for two Business class tickets to Italy had to spend  hours in JFK.,3,-0.232618709
A Rudd,It is insulting that after having paid a premium for a business class ticket you are then required to pay for virtually everything in its lounge - unless you are satisfied with 'yogurt-covered pretzels' and a mass-produced domestic bottled beer. Another first is being required to present your passport at check-in. The space has had some thought put into its design but the lighting is very bright and customer service indifferent at best. This is in no way an international lounge (nor airline) on par with those of its partners KLM and Air France. Instead head across T to the Oasis Lounge where the bar is open food free and Faux Noise isn't blaring over the chatter. And you're not required to show your passport.,2,-1.015756808
J Keddy,This is a very cold and dull lounge. The staff are far from welcoming - it's as if you have ruined their day just by being there. As someone else mentioned there is evidence of cost cutting throughout - fine for those in economy but not what one expects after paying so much more for a business class experience. The refreshments on offer were pathetic. I was there for an early morning flight and there were baskets of mini croissants and pan au chocolat cereal toast and coffee/juices etc. % self-service. Miserable staff hanging around like vultures ready to clear your table before you have finished swallowing your last mouthful. You can go out to the duty free shops but they don't bother to offer to look after your bags and coats so you need to lug them around with you if you are carrying anything of value which I usually am (laptop etc).,2,-1.015756808
A Excel,Arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport a little early in order to check out BA/QF first class lounge. Very disappointed. Nothing special - if anything the Business Class lounge opposite was as good if not better. The First lounge was small very limited food - cheese platter  choices two types of rolls and wraps. Only difference between business and First was choice of wines and champagne.,4,0.550519389
Paul Donovan,The lounge in Miami needs a total refurbishment its old fashioned with a poor selection of food. A real let down.,2,-1.015756808
A Chung,Sitting in lounge right now. The new outdoor area is nice but charging $ for a beer? What kind of lounge does that? Have beer prices risen that much? Terribly slow wifi connection and the lounge gets really crowded. Food selection is nothing compared to other international lounges.,3,-0.232618709
Karen Gettman,Disappointed to see the same old in JFK. Here you pay for anything beyond lousy wine and celery/crackers/olives. They have even eliminated cheese! I fly monthly business-class to London - and whilst I enjoy the Delta lounge at Heathrow I find the new JFK T lounge another American embarrassment - why can't we behave as other lounges do?,3,-0.232618709
John Robinson,Not worth the extra cost in my opinion. The lounge was busy - it was difficult to get a seat. The breakfast was paltry - tiny croissants for instance. There was no sense of luxury - an air of convenience and cost-effectiveness. Staff were not particularly polite.,2,-1.015756808
Bill Atkins,Though this lounge is very new it really is not big enough to handle the  flights which leave quite close together in the evening. The staff however are exemplary - very welcoming professional and friendly with a real sense of enjoying their interaction with the passengers. There is a good selection of food and drinks with very acceptable pre-flight dining. If only the T lounges were the same as this one.,5,1.333657488
G Simpson,Shocked is all I can say. After trying the Concorde Lounge earlier in the year the Terraces was a huge let down. We got to the airport  hours before the flight yet told the spa was full. The food was mediocre we had to ask for champagne. It was comfortable enough and the wifi was good.,3,-0.232618709
Shokry Mahmoud,"Arrived to airport by  am, my flight was by am. I was directed to Royal lounge by check in staff. Reach to the lounge downstairs, we found it closed and the staff said we open by am! This is ridiculous. Back again to information desk, he recommend other lounge far away from the gate. Lounge was too cold, food is not good. Very poor welcome from the staff at reception. I
think Egyptair should wake up to the condition of business class lounge and send staff for more training on how to welcome customers.",2,-1.015756808
C Wajsberg,I am writing this while sitting in the lounge for a KLM flight. Large lounge with a restaurant in the middle. Complimentary food served here some veggy crackers olives and cheese. Soft drinks cheap red and white wine and beer complimentary - anything else needs to be paid for. Shame on you KLM using this lounge. This lounge has earned the medal for the worst.,3,-0.232618709
M Mejia,A lot less cosy than what I remembered visiting this lounge  years back. I suppose the fact that it was really crowded made it more like a higher end gate waiting lounge than a business class lounge. There were lots of corners where you can potentially find your own corner but I think that the place is approaching overcapacity. There is a good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages available (with Blue Moon Belgian beer on tap!) and a healthy selection of munchies as well as coffee. Wifi was fast and reliable and there were enough TV screens to help while the time away while waiting for boarding. Toilets were in horrible condition.,4,0.550519389
Don Noble,Lounge is very poor in comparison to other airlines business lounges throughout the world. Only  showers for which you have to register your name and be called when they are available. Food selection is basic snack type but not readily replenished. Layout is not very well optimised and seating is limited. Overall appearance was drab & uninviting. Certainly does not live up to the description on their website.,3,-0.232618709
Clive Drake,As a Gold card member I could use this lounge (unlike Heathrow's Concorde lounge which is exclusive for st passengers) as I awaited my flight to Antigua. Carpet very worn and dull as was most of the chairs and seating,,
D Wright,It's the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure. Staff members have always gone the extra mile to deal with seating upgrade and flight change and other special requests. Efficiency and smiles are a great combination. Food and drink are average but adequate. Too bad the washrooms are outside the lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Fabrizio Ferraro,This lounge is shared by BA and Qantas and doesn't have many seats. So unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat. The seats are old and need a make over. The choice of drinks is limited. Only one red one white and one sparkling wine (not champagne). The choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and Asian snacks (very tasty). Okay selections of newspapers no TV screens and a limited number of IT stations with one out of order. The lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms.,3,-0.232618709
E Furlong,The lounge was dirty there was a very cool unwelcoming reception from the female at the desk who was extremely unhelpful. The quality of the food and drinks available was pitiful. All in all a really bad experience and Egyptair should wake up very quickly and rectify the problem quickly.,1,-1.798894906
E Lane,Upgraded to business class because I had a  hour stopover in Cairo before travelling to Manchester England. I expected a reasonable comfortable stay. How wrong I was! The seating was extremely uncomfortable and not too clean the food and drinks on offer were at best mediocre. The lounge was air conditioned and thus cold. I never removed my outdoor coat and was still really cold. I feel I wasted money upgrading for something I didn't get. The flights were good but the stay in the lounge abysmal.,1,-1.798894906
J Ravyst,Don't expect anything special in Cairo with the exception of staff and their service. For the smokers they have a dedicated lounge. Type of food and drinks are limited and there are very few television screens to watch the news or sports.,3,-0.232618709
Chris Mastinson,Visited both Delta lounges in Minneapolis. Lounge C was extremely quiet also has a nice view of planes landing and taking off and I believe its bigger than the other one. The self-service bar still exists there. The other lounge at terminal F/G is more modern more of open and the bar is more lively but there's no open bar there. Both lounges : same snack pretzels hummus crackers apples coffee and some newspapers. Free fast internet connection and excellent staff. I spent  minutes at the LAX lounge more snacks but it was relatively crowded.,4,0.550519389
G Schultink,"Regular visitor as Diamond member over many years. Continue to be disappointed in the food assortment of Delta lounges. Standard fare are crackers plastic wrapped cheese slices seasoned pretzel/nuts rather than healthy nuts bagels carrot and celery sticks. Why not a better selection of fruit real fruit juices rather then the high fructose ""fruit"" drinks some decent bread and yogurt selection some warm snacks/pastas such as offered at other clubs. We do not expect Delta to reach the  star quality of Singapore airlines and others but this is barely making for a -star experience. It even pales with the -star rating of KLM and Air France sky team partners. One can fly to various locations worldwide for % of the Delta business fare on Singapore Airlines and Emirates for example and have a -star experience. Business class fares on Delta have gone out of sight (especially for what is offered as a package)!",3,-0.232618709
B Stein,Very disappointing. Delta does not have a lounge in Rome. I have a priority pass. My husband did not bring his priority pass so we paid for him. Alitalia lounge was very hot air quality is bad. I am here at the lounge writing this review. The women at the desk one in particular did not even raise her face to ask me what I need. I wanted to ask if there is wifi! Very rude people and the lady trying to clean the tables was rude. We are not eat anything nor drinking anything for it is very uncomfortable. Delta should investigate this relationship with Alitalia and to tell people that in Rome they do not have a lounge. They should refund me or priority pass should also investigate this shameful behavior and unhealthy condition no air conditioning.,1,-1.798894906
Clive Drake,"There is a daily flight to/from Gatwick from Antigua and it is a disGrace that BA use this shoddy ""shared"" lounge - landside at Antigua VC Bird Airport. Its like a tomb - windows are shuttered and those not - look into a large waiting area that never seems to be used. An array of snacks are left on the sideboard - a bit of cheese and raw vegetables - drinks are served by a waiter. Dire - if you travel to Antigua and miss it dont worry about it.",1,-1.798894906
F Ferraro,The BA lounge in MXP is an old style terrace lounge. The lounge is very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming. The food served is quite good all Italian style focaccia sandwiches small pizzas etc. The choice of drinks is good with lots of typical Italian drinks available. Good selection of newspapers and a few IT stations although only one was working properly. There was also a smoking room available. Dirty plates and glasses were cleared continuously.,4,0.550519389
Derek Salter,Convenient and spacious. Helpful staff. Limited food and drinks but pleasant. Although fairly new starting to look jaded. Chairs grubby walls and toilet areas dirtier than they should be. Isn't going to wear well unless upgraded and deep cleaned.,3,-0.232618709
C Binder,We used these lounges twice there are four of them with different names but all essentially the same. There is no alcohol (there is none on any Egyptair flights as well). Food/juices are okay nothing phenomenal. Bathrooms were clean though no showers or anything. Check-in on the main concourse for the First/Business class area has lounge-like furniture coffee table and WiFi access.,3,-0.232618709
Richard Naismith,Smallish lounge but quite comfortable. Excellent free wifi. No alcohol but nice range of soft drinks and juices. Only negative was no showers. I asked at the desk when I entered and they told me there are no showers in the whole airport. That should be remedied.,3,-0.232618709
Christoph Krause,Probably the poorest lounge I ever saw on a great international airport. Awkward seats and tables and in particular no reasonable food. Only some nuts and crackers along with small cheese pieces packed in plastic foil. On the plus side: rest rooms clean. Cheapest toilet paper quality you can imagine though.,3,-0.232618709
Xingcai Sun,There were  lounges at the Delta terminal the smaller one near security check was much more quiet less folks self-service bar terrible snacks showers which was fine. The larger one was full of people kids full-service bar larger selection (and maybe better) quality of food. Very comfortable great wifi.,4,0.550519389
J Moe,Recently visited  different Sky Club lounges in Atlanta terminals T and A. Club entrances are hidden down short halls and poorly marked. No inviting feeling to entering the lounges. Staff and the check in desks were friendly and helpful. The overall appearance is that of a tired out of date environment. Lounges seemed cramped and small. Furniture in the A terminal was actually dirty and stained. The snacks appeared old and picked over. Bathrooms were old looking cramped and dirty. The Delta staff were the only good part of the experience. The American Airline Admirals Clubs in Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth put the Atlanta clubs to shame for overall appearance and welcoming feeling.,2,-1.015756808
Martin Brown,This is a shared lounge used by several airlines - pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available. Lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean. On one side is quite a large bar. No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally  feet away. This lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and I wish more were like this.,3,-0.232618709
J Maclean,This is easily the poorest of all the BA st class lounges I have frequented. It is a reasonably large space which fills up very rapidly within a few hours of the  to  late night flights back to London. Very often you will struggle to find a comfortable seat. I no longer eat anything in this lounge as the quality of the catering is not up to scratch. You will hardly ever find a UK newspaper (unless you are - hours early) and I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this lounge - not even a good view. It is well overdue a complete refurbishment and the general decor is grubby and tatty. Singapore - London is a very busy route for BA and presumably therefore somewhat profitable. If you travel the same route with Singapore Airlines the lounges are far superior as is the general lounge service.,2,-1.015756808
Andy Lowe,This lounge is in the newly opened T at Cairo Airport. It was dirty and staffed by bored surly individuals. The drink offerings were minimal and food was a choice of dried up croissants or mini pizzas. The irony is that the open eating areas at this airport are now really good. How does Egyptair manage to retain its Star Alliance membership? Take my advice at Cairo avoid the lounge and enjoy some good food in the public eating areas.,1,-1.798894906
Paul Jones,Used the new Star Alliance/Egyptair business lounge at Cairo airport terminal . Very disappointing. All the newspapers were in Arabic and no magazines. Warm soft drinks stacked on a table and loud children everywhere. There are two rooms one with a nice view of the runways that was jam packed and another which is rather grim that was also pretty full. The floors are tile and echo sounds horribly. Some sandwiches and finger foods and a kettle with hot water. No television or flight monitors in room number two. The staff were indifferent and uninterested in the passengers. Frankly waiting in the main terminal in the food court area offered more options for food/beverages and was just as comfortable as the lounge. Disappointing and not much of an improvement over the old dismal terminal  business lounge.,2,-1.015756808
S Riegert,Hidden in between gates at the degrading Memphis International Airport. The desk staff are generally curt and rude which I have come to expect at airport lounges. Open full bar consists of self-pour liquor. Pretty decent brands not top-shelf or anything but respectable. The house wines are decent enough i.e. a step above boxed wine. The snacks are laughable carrots celery packaged ranch mixed nuts and crackers abound. The bar area wasn't that clean either. The advantage of this lounge is that it is quiet (in spite of how many people were there) a function of the numerous small rooms. The chairs are comfortable and the soft lighting was nice. Free WIFI NYT and WSJ as well. Bathrooms leave something to be desired.,4,0.550519389
Coley Stone,On most concourses they lounges are located upstairs so it's either a lengthy wait for an elevator or the stairs. For those of you who have not been to ATL it's hot! When you arrive in this lounge it's crowded and you have to request beers. The food is usually old and looks picked over. Some of the seating is comfortable others not. It's not a terrible place to go for a drink while you wait for your flight but the VIP feeling is lacking.,3,-0.232618709
C Stone,For international flights departing from Brussels Skyteam Elite and Elite plus members use the British Airways lounge - quality and service are top notch! The front desk people are friendly and helpful. The seating is mediocre but drink and food selection make up for that. They have the most delicious pastries in the morning. The only negative is that there is no restroom inside the lounge. You have to walk a bit far down the hall to reach the nearest toilet.,5,1.333657488
F Ferraro,I found the lounge very comfortable. Enough space for everyone although it was a Friday before a bank holiday weekend. The choice of hot food is limited but appropriate. Used plates and glasses are promptly removed by the staff who are polite and assist requests promptly. I didn't use the showers but the Elemis receptionist went out of her way and gave me her unused personal Elemis lip saver although these products were not generally available to passengers. BA should improve the magazines selection.,4,0.550519389
Gordon Wallace,The new club lounge at T is very nice large and spacious with different seating areas. There was a large selection of both hot and cold food. The red and white wines are in different seating areas which is slightly strange and champagne is only available if you ask. The staff were attentive and customer service could not be faulted.,5,1.333657488
L Hughes,Great improvement on the old lounge. Quite small but well appointed. The First restaurant excellent - although we were the only two customers - with service both efficient and attentive. Bit of a walk to get there from the underpass walkway however although if you're not in a desperate hurry it's no real problem. As usual this comes at the end of a mass of confusion and waiting for security even in the Premium queue.,4,0.550519389
Kevin Tunnicliffe,The choice of food for our three hour time here was between mini pizzas and croissants which you could then warm up in a none too clean microwave. Choice of drinks was also very limited - we nabbed the last three cans of diet coke in the lounge. Coffee was instant and made with lukewarm water from a flask by a member of staff. Egyptair is a dry airline and so is its lounge. This lounge in terminal one is situated on a balcony but otherwise open to the rest of the airport so noise and so forth a problem. Seating was reasonably comfortable but old and worn. Staff were chatting to themselves except for the toilet attendants who were intent on making you pay for the privilege of using the loos.,1,-1.798894906
J Quinterno,I recently waited out a long delay ( hours) at the Sky Club in Terminal  at JFK. Overall this is a spacious lounge with a mix of seating areas (TV lounge bar workstations etc). While the lounge was busy it never felt overly packed. The staff were efficient and drink menu was extensive but as is common with Sky Clubs the food selection was limited to light snacks. One desk agent provided excellent service when my flight was cancelled and worked to minimize the disruption and provide me with options. Given the overall poor state of Terminal  it was much less stressful to out the delay in the club rather than in the general boarding area.,3,-0.232618709
Scott Bingham,This is a very busy lounge. The worst part (other than there's practically no snacks) is that the Men's room is an absolute disaster / pig stye / complete mess no matter the time or day of the week that you visit. On top of this the 'free' T-mobile internet service may as well be nothing at all. It is beyond slow probably worse than k dial up. Why?,1,-1.798894906
John Maley,"This is the new improved lounge and is for those entitled to ""First Class"" privileges but not travelling First Class I was travelling domestically so this was why I used this lounge. Seriously this is the best BA can come up with after how many years. I asked for the restaurant and was shown the buffet. The lounge was nice even allowing for the fact that it was hot in some areas and cool in others. Showers were basic. Staff friendly and helpful. Not worth the effort to try it out.",3,-0.232618709
Bill Atkins,Had a longish layover due to BA delay and resulting re-booking so decided to use one of the cabanas. These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent. For an exclusively First Class lounge this could be better.,4,0.550519389
D Wright,The new Sky Club at Seatac is a huge improvement over the previous overcrowded club. There is much more space so that it's not teeming with travelers late morning and midday when a number of flights to Asia leave. Excellent facilities for laptops and charging devices. There's a good bar with a number of premium (and pricey) selections - you can still get the house selections at no charge. The snack selection is minimal. Sky Club staff are friendly efficient and helpful as they were in the old club. There's a good view of Mount Rainier out the window - on a clear day.,5,1.333657488
J Quinterno,Delta SkyClub at CVG is one of the nicer ones. The club is large and conveniently located for transferring passengers. It offers a mix of seating types a large window that offers views of the field. The staff were quite friendly. In many ways this club is nicer than many of those at ATL and other Delta hub cities.,3,-0.232618709
J Quinterno,I recently spent approximately  minutes in the PDX Sky Club prior to boarding a red-eye flight to ATL. Overall the PDX club was fine. It was of a decent size with a mix of seating areas and types (TV lounge quiet areas bar etc.). The only negative was that the club was lightly staffed (one agent and one bar attendant) and both staffers clearly were looking to hustle people out of the club and close up for the night,,
S Marcella,Mediocre like everything else on El Al. The lounge is okay but kind of run down. The food is okay but not great. The staff is polite but not welcoming.  The bottom line is that I would never pay to use the El Al lounge at either JFK or TLV. If the ticket is free then go ahead.,2,-1.015756808
James Pemberton,I recently read a review on this website regarding the Terrace lounge facilities at Jersey airport and was shocked to find it had deteriorated even further from the original submission. Food and dirty plates had been left out for many hours stained carpets and a poorly stocked bar compounded by a member of staff deciding to leave the lounge at  pm half an hour before the last flight was due to depart. Passengers had no idea it had incurred a delay and our only source of information came from data streams located on TVâ€™s m away from the lounge. Simply terrible British Airways I would recommend that anyone flying Business class from Jersey attempts to spend as much time away from the lounge as you will only be disappointed with the service.,1,-1.798894906
Fabrizio Ferraro,Club Europe Lounge at Gatwick is very nice. It is on two floors and very spacious. The food selection is simple (only sandwiches pasta salads and similar and cheese with biscuits) plus the usual snacks. The only hot food served is soup. Very good selection of drinks with champagne on request very good selection of newspapers and magazines. IT workstations worked very well and are very modern. The toilet facilities are good with excellent showers and you can ask for Elemis products. The only downside was the lack of atmosphere. The lounge is very quite and with no music played in the background it could have been very boring.,4,0.550519389
Simon Taylor,Small but fine for the number of travellers on the day. Good atmosphere. Standard of food and drink good but range limited in comparison to say Galleries. so scores down a little.,4,0.550519389
Charles Pratt,The style of this lounge is in a Southern plantation setting. I found it clean neat and well kept up. There was no trash sitting around waiting to be picked up on the tables. Kids area was a nice area with a lot of choices for them to pick from. The problem with this and other Delta lounges the food selection is very poor. Tailmix cookies and fruit can only go so far.,3,-0.232618709
Sarah Perry,I have to agree - reception desk is neither inviting nor friendly. We had a miserable experience checking in with Laura - she was rude completely unhelpful and frankly dismissive. I have never in my life experienced that level of unfriendly customer service - anywhere! Naturally I asked to speak to her manager. She called her manager on the phone spoke to him and then reported to me that he didn't want to talk to me - he was too busy. And then she hung up the phone. Fortunately a Delta representative happened to walk by and we were able to flag her down and she immediately helped us and we were settled into the lounge. We let her know how rude the reception is at the front and yes we called out Laura specifically. I thought it was so weird that upon seeing our displeasure with her service that Laura never apologized that her manager didn't want to speak to us and that in the end it was a Delta rep and not a Sky Team rep who ended up assisting us and providing customer service. I have sent a letter to Sky Team and Delta to tell them about the experience and to reiterate that the front desk needs customer service training and possibly better management - clearly there isn't much supervision going on up front.,3,-0.232618709
Harry Aronowicz,Clean and spacious lounge with a very large food selection. Furthermore shower facilities (not used by me) and even spa facilities (again - not used by me). Computer terminals good view onto the tarmac. Lounge has a large number of El Al staff members on duty which are all eager to help. Much better then the Dan lounge which is used by other airlines in Tel Aviv.,5,1.333657488
M Gershom,"The new Terminal  has a large well-appointed King David Lounge in addition to the tired and overcrowded Dan Lounge. (Anybody with a gold credit card can get access to the Dan lounge - regardless of service class.) King David access is restricted to El Al passengers in business class (there is a separate First Class lounge I cannot vouch for) or to members of the King David Club (El Al's upper-tier frequent flyer program also available for an annual fee). I have a King David pass from work and use the lounge whenever I fly out. It is located at the beginning of the ""D"" concourse to your left - the four concourses are four compass points on the central atrium. There is good food available in the Mediterranean style (kosher dairy and parve) - as well as cakes espresso machines soft drinks. Many seats have power outlets next to them (make sure you have a Euro/Israeli -prong plug or adapter) as well as Ethernet ports. There's an upstairs deck if it's too crowded downstairs which also offers workstations with PCs (in case you didn't bring your own laptop) as well as a branch of Carmel Forest Spa (no experience cannot comment). There is also a business center downstairs as well as a service desk. Design is pretty nifty. I haven't seen a huge selection of alcoholic beverages but I'm not much of a drinker so it doesn't bother me. Coffee is as good as can be expected from automated espresso machines.",4,0.550519389
John Wilson,Only food available was cheese and crackers. A waitress eventually appeared but did not approach anyone - she had to be asked for drinks. She brought them through and was never seen again. The room is fully enclosed and looks out on the seating area in the departure lounge - before security. The decor is drab a few magazines to read as well as some out of date newspapers. Couldn't wait to get on the plane. Shame as it soured the end of our holiday slightly.,1,-1.798894906
Ian Henderson,Pretty busy lounge with good wifi and announcement when new UK newspapers arrived. Alcoholic drinks only available through a servery with occasional missing staff and therefore short queues and delays. Pleasant and efficient staff.,4,0.550519389
Andreas Switz,Small lounge it was hard to find a seat. No real meal choices difficult to get something to drink as the bar tender was always leaving the bar. Everything seemed quite dirty. Staff uninterested they send passengers for the Air France flight to Paris one hour to early to the gate. Not really a nice place.,2,-1.015756808
Chris White,The lounge is located in the satellite building next to gate . Very convenient for the gates. The welcome was a little rehearsed and not particularly friendly (but not unfriendly). The lounge is medium size but during my visit very busy. Available food was nuts shrink wrapped cheese and some carrot sticks. Drinks available from a server with a rather stern attitude. I had a G&T but it looked well stocked (although the tonic was from one of those awful fizzy drink guns). The seat was dirty and the rest of the lounge felt grubby warm and crowded. There were high tables to sit at and plenty of power outlets throughout. There's one hour free wireless in the airport. Not sure if there is free wireless in the lounge. Overall I was disappointed but have been to worse lounges.,1,-1.798894906
Chris White,I found this lounge to be characterless and a little unfriendly. The toilets were filthy but the rest of the lounge was clean. Plenty of seating - watch out for the dangling lights I saw one man hit his head very hard when getting up from his seat. I was there early in the morning and breakfast was available - average nothing special. Alcohol was not available in the lounge until after am (my flight was at :!).,2,-1.015756808
C Lev,Dan Lounge is the ONLY lounge at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv regardless of carrier! The lounge is always packed and with Israeli backpackers and whole extended families that are clearly not traveling in First or Business Class! I think they have some kind of deal with a credit card company or something which allows easy access to the airports ONLY lounge. It only has two toilet cubicles that are unisex and one was out of order so men women and children all had to line up to use the one cubicle! The cold food and beverage table seemed more like a school lunch line with children and youth grabbing things and small children playing with the espresso machine. Last but not least airport staff and airline maintenance and ground crew come through to grab food and drinks laid out for the passengers. I witnessed an aircraft maintenance guy come through a back door and with his clearly dirty fingers and overalls finger several pieces of cake till he found one in the middle he liked stuffed it in his mouth leaving the others aside and walked out the same way he came in! Ben Gurion need to open several lounges to meet the need of its passengers and levels and status. Truly the worst airport lounge I've been in. Really disappointing since the new terminal  is so nice!,1,-1.798894906
L Rainard,The Deck Lounge was remarkably easy to find. It was somewhat crowded the morning I visited - a nice selection of cheese crackers drinks etc. My disappointment was the inability to connect to wifi and limited tools available on the lounge computers. The host tried to connect me to wifi without success.,4,0.550519389
Francis Boylin,Delta Sky Club system in Terminal E has  clubs. Both have some snacks soft drinks bad coffee and lots of booze. According to the advertisements Delta is now a world class airline. If these lounges are any indication Delta is a poster boy for how not to be a world class airline. There are no showers no tooth brushes no changing rooms no food except snacks no fruit juices no computers and no telephones. It seems that all you have is what you can bring with you. I'm not comparing Delta to airlines such as Singapore British Airways and Korean lounges which are great but to US carrier lounges which far surpass the Delta product.,2,-1.015756808
Brian Smith,I went to several Sky Club lounges (MSP MSY RDU) and they are adequate. They do not offer much in the way of food but not bad if your flight is delayed. There is free wifi in all the lounges and even computer use for those not traveling with their own. The one I entered in terminal E at ATL was really not good. It was the old style (not renovated like many are now) quite large but very crowded. There were numerous children in there! Staff behind the bar were unprofessional and talking about inter-lounge politics and not attentive to staff and the bathrooms were dirty and locks didn't lock properly. It's just slightly better than being in the general boarding area.,3,-0.232618709
Phil Kelly,"Either I've become spoiled by (even domestic lounges) lounges in other countries and of other airlines or Delta has set a low bar. Coffee is a ready mix type machine and taste as such. A simple drip machine from Target would serve a much better product. The food selection well there was none. Yogurt some granola and not a bowl insight to put it in. The rest was cookie/biscuit type snacks. If alcohol were a staple of any sort one would be in luck. Plenty of booze and beer. Get a clue Delta! You are supposedly a ""World Class"" airline now.",2,-1.015756808
D Wright,Personnel are very pleasant but the facility is grossly overcrowded. Before the purchase of Northwest Delta had its lounge (larger and more comfortable) in the B Concourse. Now that lounge has closed and Sky Club operates in the South Satellite. There are just too many passengers on too many international flights that all seem to leave within an hour or so of each other.,3,-0.232618709
Bradley Baker,"We were returning to Glasgow from Langkawi via Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, and had  hours in KL so we decided to go to the Lounge. I was only allowed for one extra guest to the lounge but they let me take my two kids as well. Some great food, and array of drinks, tea, coffee, beers and soft drinks. There was a great window to see aircraft and there was good wifi. There were many computers. There were no Sofas.",6,2.116795586
Rob Bowden,"I have used Emirates lounges around the world and this is one of the best. It's just the right size to hold a full A's worth of First and Business passengers without looking overcrowded. The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices, desserts and lots of good French cheeses. There's the usual self service bar, fridges full of soft drinks and freshly squeezed juices, champagne and wine and a good coffee machine. There's plenty of comfortable seating and a nice observation deck outside where you can stand and watch the A arrive and park up right outside. it has a good business centre and nice bathrooms with showers. Overall a very nice and relaxing environment.",6,2.116795586
Rob Bowden,"This is the best Emirates Lounge I've used mainly because the food is so good but it's also a very nice, relaxing environment to wait before your  hour flight back to Dubai. The first time I used it I checked in at pm for a midnight flight so spent several hours there. The second time not so long but on both occasions we had an excellent  course restaurant standard meal with lots of good, Far Eastern and European choices which were constantly replenished by the busy staff. There's  self service bar areas with good aged spirits, mixers, wine and champagne and a good coffee machine. After dinner we relaxed in the comfy chairs and passed the time with a few drinks, magazines and newspapers. There's a good business centre, free wifi and bathrooms with showers. Overall Excellent, well done Emirates.",6,2.116795586
Rob Bowden,"I have transited Dubai many times on Emirates who use Terminal  which is broken down into Concourse A/B/C. I have used all  Business lounges and A is by far the best as it's new. C is old and tired and B is under renovation so avoid, if you have a long layover take the short train ride to A. The Business Lounge in A is massive and runs the whole length of the building with several food areas, seating areas, bathrooms with showers, business centres etc. The beauty of this lounge is that it has a proper smoking lounge with good ventilation so as a non smoker traveling with a smoker I don't mind going in. It's a proper bar with chesterfield sofas and TV's on the walls, not just a smoke room. In the food areas there's a hot buffet and lots of cold choices, fruit, yogurts etc. Plenty of drinks options and coffee machines that make a very nice macchiato. A is also the A terminal so has the  deck air bridges and you board directly from the lounge. A is a  but I've given / due to the other  lounges.",6,2.116795586
Rob Bowden,"I often use this lounge as I have the Emirates Gold card so get a lounge invitation regardless what class I'm flying in. It's typical of most Emirates lounges as they all have the same decor and furniture although this one is quite small when compared to Heathrow. There's always  staff in Emirates uniform at check-in who are always warm and friendly and will explain everything if it's your first time. There's comfortable seating with little coffee tables to your left with a big TV and the dining area and self service bar is on the right. And I mean self service, there's no annoying staff who try to pour your drink for you. I've never had a bad meal here, the food is always excellent with plenty of choice. There's a hot buffet and always a soup and a chiller with cold starters, deserts and cheeses. They have  self service bar areas with a good choice of spirits, wine and champagne and fridges full of mixers, beers and water, a good coffee machine and lots of tea choices. There's the usual business area with computers and a printer and there's nice bathrooms with showers. The only negative is there's virtually no mobile phone signal.",6,2.116795586
Rob Bowden,"The Emirates Lounge in Delhi is awesome and massive, there's only  Emirates flights to Dubai per day, all at least  hours apart so I'm not sure why this lounge is so big, however my son and I enjoyed it on our stopover from Kathmandu to London via Dubai especially after the nightmare of the transit gates in Delhi! The food was excellent with plenty of hot and cold choices. There's a self service bar with a good choice of spirits, mixers, beers, wine and champagne plus a good coffee machine and teas. You get well looked after on Emirates. After dinner we found another self service bar at the far end of the lounge which we had virtually to ourselves. There's more than enough comfortable seating all around. There's a good business centre and bathrooms with showers. The only negative it was too warm, the air con wasn't cool enough. Overall a nice haven from the chaos outside.",6,2.116795586
Amit Pinge,It is a common lounge for many airlines oprating from Lagos. Seating is not too comfortable. During peak hours even getting a place to sit is difficult. Food and drink availabilty is Ok. Service quality is poor. Better place to spend time waiting for boarding as other waiting areas at Lagos Airport is horrible.,5,1.333657488
J Vancurova,We got to the lounge at . am. It was pretty busy. We decided to have a shower after long flight. We were very lucky because the showers were free. In  hour the lounge was packed which is not too bad because it's such a big and spacious lounge. HOWEVER there are  blocks of male toilets and only  block of female toilets which I found unacceptable! They are doing refurbishments so I just hope there will be more female toilets in very near future. There were queues for female toilets and showers. The demand is absolutely not met for female passengers.,5,1.333657488
Marian Clarke,Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from  slices of cheese on  plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help! No announcements in English - fine for me but not so great for those who don't speak either Arabic or rapid French. Really poor!,3,-0.232618709
Graham Clark,This was a very sorry excuse for a business lounge. Far too small and a poor selection of food and beverage. Maybe more time should have been spent on practical chairs and space than on decor!,2,-1.015756808
J Lennon,The lounge is a joke. It is small hence there is little chance of getting a table to yourself. I don't eat meat and I had the choice of rice lukewarm polenta bread crackers cheese salad and fruit. Pitiful. No Baileys.,2,-1.015756808
Chris Humphreys,At .am this huge lounge was impossibly crowded with long queues for the toilets - and even to get a cup of coffee. It was difficult to find a comfortable seat and the food was unappetising. We had Â½ hours turnaround between flights - nowhere near enough in an airport of this size long walks between gates and with long queues for security as well. We wanted a quiet relaxing break breakfast and shower after long flights from New Zealand. No chance - the experience was uncomfortable and stressful. No chance of a shower either - more long queues - facilities totally inadequate for an airport of this size.,2,-1.015756808
P Speltincx,After a long flight from Sydney I had  hours in the Emirates lounge concourse B before my connecting flight to Brussels. A nightmare! I spent the entire  hours with - other tired men waiting in queue to take a shower. The lounge is huge and crowded not the kind of place where you can relax and unwind. This is clearly the chink in Emirates armor. They should make separate lounges for business class and for silvers. Next time star alliance. Writing this whilst still waiting for a shower. Must have seen at least  persons come and leave shaking their head when they saw the queue. Lots of staff around but what's the point when the only thing they can do is ask to see your boarding pass over and over again.,2,-1.015756808
E York,This lounge is not operated by Emirates but it is the one they give access to. It is terrible. Full with passengers from multiple airlines. The food is not fresh and is cup noodle based cheap and tasteless. There is no power point the drinks are from cans and the staff couldn't care less. Emirates change lounge!,1,-1.798894906

Ronald Kempson,Had a  hr stop over on the outward trip to Perth sat in the A lounge for half the time service not at all friendly food average noticed there were two shower rooms both had  people waiting to use them gave up after a while and went to the hotel out of the lounge and used their showers at least they had  rooms although it was $ was well worth it. Eventually was told on the th hour there was a B lounge closer to my departure gate not at all easy to find signs up in the air with arrows pointing every where more relaxer chairs needed and more customer friendly staff needed. On the return trip with a hr stop over showers still over crowded. Emirates need to address this shortfall before they lose clients to other airlines,2,-1.015756808
A Hill,A small and overcrowded lounge there were  flights leaving at around the same time so the lounge was packed with not enough seats for all. Food and drinks OK but nothing special. Emirates need to seriously consider increasing the size of this lounge.,3,-0.232618709
A Hill,A spacious and well maintained lounge good choice of drinks and hot food recommended. Ground staff not so friendly but all other aspects positive . Free Wifi throughout the lounge. Location of the lounge not obvious have to follow the signs which are not so clear.,4,0.550519389
G Smith,A relatively new lounge and a VAST improvement on the previous offering at Glasgow. Typical Emirates decor but very light and open. Staff at the reception desk were welcoming and took the time to give a personal tour of the lounge facilities to first time visitors. Seating gave a high level of privacy if required as well as more communal seating arrangements. Food and drink selection excellent and staff were attentive to ensuring the were replaced or topped up regularly. Business area was well sited and conducive to getting urgent work matters tidied up before boarding.,5,1.333657488
P Amit,Common lounge for multiple airlines. Space is cramped. Seating arrangement is average. Food & Beverages are available but service is poor. Wifi connectivity OK. The place is better than the open waiting area of Lagos Airport where even the basic airconditiong not available.,3,-0.232618709
G Nock,A great place to relax. The selection of food and drink is very good as is service from staff. It is very close to the boarding gate that Emirates there is a separate gate for Business class passengers From the Chauffeur drop off to the lounge took approx.  minutes,5,1.333657488
R Lyon,My first experience of the First Class Lounge in Dubai and I was not impressed. It was very impersonal and I was disappointed. The only marked difference from the Business Lounges was that it was Table served for Dining. The offerings were nothing special either. I was absolutely appalled to find a large open Smoking area adjoining the Dining Room with dreadful tobacco smells drifting right through. Very Poor indeed. Frankly I would prefer the Business Lounges at Dubai and would certainly not pay the money to use First again.,3,-0.232618709
P Amit,Enough space and seating arrangement for the guests. Good place to relax before boarding with good choice of food & beverages. Staff assists with the boarding time. Overall a good place to spend time at Delhi T.,4,0.550519389
K Ryan,This lounge hardly qualifies as a lounge at all. It has no shower facilities it's sparsely furnished in a very stark environment that resembles a doctors surgery. No dedicated wireless ( you have to access the Logan airport free wifi and keep logging in when it locks you out). Frankly you would be better off hanging out in the general concourse which is what we ended up doing. The so called lounge is in the Jet Blue terminal which is a budget type US airline and the lounge resembles a budget type lounge. Certainly not what one would expect from an airline like Emirates. At the risk of sounding like a snob when one travels business class you expect certain things in a lounge. For anyone who has visited the Qantas lounge in Karratha airport (regional airport in NW Australia) expect a slightly lower standard and that Emirates Boston Logan Airport. This lounge lets Emirates reputation down big time.,2,-1.015756808
A Brien,This has to be the biggest let down of the Emirates experience . I was in the older terminal as I was flying on a  and the lounge is terrible. Breakfast of cold toast lined up in baskets and who knows how long it has been sitting there. Showers - there are only a few for the couple of hundred passengers and there was no cold water only hot. Toilets the same three men's cubicles so a line was the order of the day. Lastly they have a smoking area that leaks smoke to the general area. Having flown through JFK LAX SYD HKG KUL SIN LHR in the last  months on a variety of carriers this lounge gets the worst award. Emirates needs some serious work here on the basics.,2,-1.015756808
J Thomas,Superb lounge. Friendly attentive and helpful staff spotless amenities great selection of meals snacks and drinks wifi access and computer stations. Couldn't ask for anything better,5,1.333657488
Anthony Wernli,Packed and only mediocre service and food. Actually there is a better service and atmosphere outside in the ordinary restaurant and sitting in the main airport departure hall.,3,-0.232618709
Francis Soriano,The lounge for Emirates is good but can be better. The food is always excellent as well as the good view of the airport. The Wi-Fi is at an acceptable speed and there were sockets everywhere where you can plug in your device to charge. The beverages were amazing coffee juice and water. Apart from sockets there were a lot of seats and tables as well as () fountains. Quite disappointed that there wasn't any lie-flat seats.,4,0.550519389
M Pengel,My experience was great. Arrived at . AM from Dammam. No crowds had an excellent  hour sleep in one of the quiet lounges on one of the beds. I had a shower no queues. Showers clean warm/hot water well ventilated and everything provided. WiFi access easy and speed was good. Food and service excellent and enough seating till my flight to Brisbane departed at . AM. Bottom line a very good lounge to have a  hour layover.,5,1.333657488
Michael Mainwaring,Had a  hour stop over in Dubai so plenty of time to sample several lounges. From previous poor experiences of the lounges I checked into the transit hotel- which was excellent. On this occasion the lounges were almost empty - probably due to Ramadan- and the staff outnumbered passengers. It almost made the lounges pleasant- but not quite. The only really good thing about the lounges are the staff in the lounge (and I exclude the reception staff who check you in).,3,-0.232618709
C Wajsberg,Welcome is sometimes friendly but not always. Nice view of airport apron. Plenty of drinks served at bar but this can create a queue of waiting customers. Food choice not great. Wifi works well and showers and toilets available. This place is still better then just waiting in airport bar before boarding your plane.,4,0.550519389
C Wajsberg,Same feeling and look as rest of this airport. Old scrummy over crowded lounge. Bad seating and poorly working wifi. Dirty toilets have not noticed if they have showers. Food quality average and drinks serve your self to the plastic cups. Tasteless coffee and this for a country growing it own and having a coffee culture. Entering the lounge one of these other things that should be taken care of as verry messy. All be it still better to stay in this lounge and drink lousy coffee for free then having to pay  usd cash only for a very poor espresso in airport coffee shop.,2,-1.015756808
C Wajsberg,Lounge has been remade and upgraded ab  months ago. Lounge looks already now as if needs another remake . Food and drinks same as before  nothing special to even very boring  end of very poor quality. Food display also with no concern of hygiene. Reception in lounge professional and fast if no passenger in front of you negotiating the price he has to pay or points he has the submit on one of his credit cards to be able to enter the lounge.,2,-1.015756808
T Morgan,I loved the fact that it was quiet no announcements clean nice food selection. I did prefer the Sydney Emirates lounge.,4,0.550519389
D Excell,Rather crowded but offering a good selection of food at breakfast time. It was good to get away from the hell that is the shopping area. However the continual extremely loud flight announcements really bothered us. Surely in this day and age Business class travellers can rely on the excellent flight info available on the screens in the lounge. This repeated noise ruined our experience and prevented us from relaxing before our next flight. The toilet facilities also seemed to be insufficient.,4,0.550519389
M Noormohamed,The lounge is easy to find. When you come up from the arrivals to the second floor there is a big sign advertising Cloud Nine. Staff friendly and make announcements for departing flights. Wifi connection worked fine once you get the password. There is a paucity of magazines. This lounge main problem is overcrowding and cleanliness of the bathrooms. There is water all over the bathroom floor and unlike EBB's Karibuni Lounge there did not appear to be an attendant who would clean and/or mop the bathrooms at regular intervals. Didn't try the food so no comment. The lounge has an open ceiling so one can hear all the commotion and noise from the main terminal building. I thought lounges are supposed to be oasis of calm. Despite all its faults the lounge is a better alternative than using facilities in the terminal building.,3,-0.232618709
C Wajsberg,Old seats from many years ago. Food choice ok all served on disposable plates with plastic knives and forks. Drinks - beer soft drinks and coffee. Lounge has no wifi one tv and is not really clean but better then having no lounge access. Lounge should improve even if it was only by providing free wifi.,2,-1.015756808
Ned Hopkins,Severely overcrowded: not a seat to be had. Apparently a flight to China was leaving about the same time as that to Washington DC as most of the people in the lounge were Chinese. Drinks and food good with a variety of western and Ethiopian dishes. Only three computers always busy.,3,-0.232618709
P Fahy,The cleanliness of the lounge and the toilets let down the Emirates experience. The reception staff x  did nothing except chat to them selves and left the customer area tables full of clutter. Surprised at this standard.,2,-1.015756808
John James,Not easy to find despite printed instructions handed out at the check-in. Small and clean with comfortable cushioned arm-chairs but few facilities beyond coffee and snacks. Clearly a waiting room not a transit lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Michael Chandler,An absolute joke! Cannot understand how Emirates can be associated with such a lounge. It is just a cordoned off area in the main departure lounge. The lounge was dirty and in desperate need of a major overhaul. The food was appalling with very poor choice. Not sure if the reason for my sickness in Dubai airport was the result of eating one small sandwich! Available drinks limited to beer colas etc and hot beverages. Wine was available but on payment of approximately Â£ for a very small bottle (about a large wine glass). There are no toilet facilities in the lounge. All in all a very disappointing experience especially after great treatment aboard Emirates flights and the lounges at Manchester and Dubai.,1,-1.798894906
H Blumenthal,Shocking in about every aspect. First of all difficult to find as no signs (it's their hub and both the airport and the airline have the same owner: the Ethiopian government!). Then once found terribly disappointing : no welcome from the staff (they pull faces to everybody entering not very comfortable very mediocre food & wine wifi working but weak and slow. Mind you it is in line with the bad experience in the business class cabin after.,1,-1.798894906
C Wajsberg,Nice small lounge. I do not know if showers are available . Wifi works fine once you received the password magazines are available all be it not a very large or interesting selection . Booz as much as you want. Food choice interesting and surprising freshly prepacked sushi and salads . Warm soup as a toaster to use your self. Many different kind of instant noodles and some of the other regular stuff. Decent place not perfect but will do.,4,0.550519389
J Cushing,Lounge was overcrowded,,
S Middleton,Very pleasantly surprised with this lounge. Plenty of room really great friendly staff. I was genuinely shocked by the breakfast food in the lounge - an immense selection and all of very high quality. The poached eggs waiting there were cooked to perfection. Bathrooms very clean with nice hand towels. An absolute standout for a business lounge.,5,1.333657488
P Bernard,This is better than the Emirates business lounges in Dubai. It is fairly new comfortable clean with polite and helpful staff and excellent catering. I've used it before departures on all of the three daily flights and always found a seat. There are hot and cold buffets (except early morning): the cold buffet is especially good. The kitchen will make food on request,,
A Trembley,This is a shared business lounge for most airlines in Dar Es Salaam overall on par with other medium- sized African airports. Large comfortable chairs. Food and drink on par with what you would buy in airport chains. Internet was terrible. Both the Wifi and available computers are so slow many machines will think the internet isn't working. If you can avoid flying through DAR I would : the airport overall is pretty bad.,2,-1.015756808
M Shah,Large lounge that cannot cope with the volumes of passengers in the mornings. Food offerings included waffles and toasted sandwiches. The food did not look too fresh. Beer soft drinks and spirits on offer. Free wifi. Not enough power points. Toilets were dirty. Not great for a flagship lounge.,2,-1.015756808
Anders Pedersen,Cloud Nine lounge in Addis (Terminal ) is spacious and excellent food : hot dishes can be dried out which is a big pity. Fresh fruit buffet snacks were so and so. Cake sections impressive. Drinks sufficient. Coffee and tea was excellent. As usual WiFi not working. Very very slow desktops may give you a lifeline to check email but people are at times queuing up to get a seat as there are maximum of  computers available. Only  power sockets for a lounge to  people is very insufficient. Furniture dark heavy and carpets could need a brush up. Toilets are small and insufficient. No shower. The analogue lounge in Terminal is much smaller food and drinks options are much less and no internet. Only one WC. Messy and completely uninteresting better stay outside.,3,-0.232618709
H Smith,Very small No wine or spirits on offer not a lot of food choice. Toilets outside of the lounge a few minutes walk away. Asked about wine and was told if I wanted it I had to go and buy it not good for someone who is travelling Business Class! Asked for a cup of tea which was produced without any milk asked for the milk none arrived so went back to ask again and the waitress was busy chatting to her friend and then finally acknowledged me.,1,-1.798894906
Patrick Maartense,Great Lounge in new terminal. Seated and services Dining free manicure or massage great showers and RR Drinks selection is out of this world.,5,1.333657488
Keith Rogers,Basic shared lounge for a number of airlines. Dial up but free internet slow but better than nothing. Food basic but fine and drink selection OK. Simple overall but better than nothing.,3,-0.232618709
Marco Catalano,This Lounge for Cloud Nine Passenger of Ethiopian Airlines is not very big but confortable. Good array of Ethiopian Food. Poor selection of Drinks. Toilets are very dirty comparable to a Railway Station. Staff service very poor.,2,-1.015756808
H Smith,Very nice lounge as stated before this is a large terminal so be prepared to walk. Was there both times at breakfast times and didn't find it crowded nice choice of food wine spirits etc. Toilets and showers were very clean.,5,1.333657488
Richard Ciszewski,Extremely disappointed with the lounge. Overcrowded. Not enough toilet facilities!!! Had to queue. forget about having a shower. Dreadful. Free WiFi did not work. Had to walk a long long way to get to it. Not worth it. Food once found was reasonable. Just far far too many people in the lounge. The worst part of the otherwise good Emirates experience by far.,3,-0.232618709
Ray Bather,Shocked at Emirates service at BKK. Checked in  hours early looking forward to a superb end to our stay in Thailand. Spent  minutes searching for the (closed) lounge. No info from the airline or check in desk. Finally and by accident found it had been relocated to the utterly awful Qantas lounge no explanation just saw an Emirates employee and followed her! What little food was there was cold and inedible. Staff completely disinterested. Soup completely cold and yet butter sachets liquid! Qantas lounge was no better than a s Barnsley railway waiting room. Only in  the food was better and the staff nicer in a British Rail waiting room. Finally negotiated a transfer to another lounge where we mingled with several tattooed gentlemen in singlets and ate some cheese on white bread sandwiches. Well done Emirates! Good customer lost.,2,-1.015756808
Jon Smith,"Lounge is small but a pleasant respite while waiting for ones flight. Food choices good, lounge was quiet and not very crowded. The staff were tremendous in keeping travelers informed of their flights, helpful suggestions about the terminal and went out of their way to accommodate travelers requests.",6,2.116795586
Greg Sierocinski,Good to explore as is huge. Food and bar sensational. Showers a nightmare. Showers downstairs were segregated fair enough but that meant only  showers available at any one time and a queue! When I complained I was directed to a in terminal hotel which had showers in a shower lounge. Not easy to find as not well signposted. Otherwise at am busy with people but service not affected. am again very very busy but access to food wine net was an ease.,5,1.333657488
B Wijesinghe,This is a large clean and comfortable lounge but the interior feels too open due to the airport terminal's tube-like design. It had many seating areas and was not crowded when I arrived after midnight on March . A menu service dining room is available and a few snacks were available near the bar. I would have preferred a buffet meal line as a supplement especially if one is in a hurry. Staff was courteous and meal service was prompt. The business center had many computer terminals and I was the only user at that time. This lounge is not modern with direct gate access like the one in Terminal A but it is a pleasant place to spend a few hours.,4,0.550519389
K Lakshmanan,The staff were polite and attentive although we were told the staff will personally come to us and remind us when it's time to board the flight - but they forgot.. Food was above average. We ended up boarding the flight as the last pax. Couldn't comment about the shower and business facilities as we didn't use them.,4,0.550519389
S Bansal,Awful lounge. Don't waste your money. Not only was it empty but when I fell asleep they woke me up saying sleeping was not allowed! After I paid them several hundred dollars! This lounge is very noisy sub par food and service and I would have booked something else if I knew.,2,-1.015756808
H Simpson,A very good lounge and service totally let down by stylish but uncomfortable seats and lack of toilets.,3,-0.232618709
Sean Clarke,Very nice atmosphere and comfortable enough after I had to tell someone who roared into his phone to go into the closed off business area. I also told staff this should not be allowed and this is their job to look for and sort these issues. It is not the guest who should have to do this. Excellent A la carte table dining (for breakfast anyway). There is a buffet for fruits yogurts etc.,4,0.550519389
K Lakshmanan,The lounge is located above duty free shopping after the immigration clearance. The lounge is huge the staff didn't bother about giving a quick tour of the lounge as they were pretty busy. The lounge has a resting and a dinning area seats were comfortable but a bit noisy with lots of families with young children. Wide selection of drinks and bar snacks. They were serving lunch so there was soup and good spread of starters and mains. The desserts were excellent too. Overall the lounge was well maintained and comfortable.,4,0.550519389
N Sutherland,Excellent lounge spacious and well laid out. Great selection of food and drinks. This is better than any of Emirates lounges in Dubai.,5,1.333657488
C Bunce,This was the lounge in the A terminal. The staff were faultless food good. Downside was the shower facilitiesâ€¦ - slightly warm water (could not get it hot) and very basic (shower not enclosed little power in shower compared to lounges such as Asiana and other airlines). No massage chairs seemed to be available which is a shame. The staff are let down by the facilities which are simply not up to the standard one expects of a new Emirates lounge.,4,0.550519389
Sophia Demasi,Excellent facilities and first class service. High quality food genuine service and comfortable environment. There appears to be only  shower in the ladies room and there is no place to recline while waiting for your flight.,5,1.333657488
L Stratos,Greeted by a polite well groomed man and directed into lounge with subdued lightening light coloured vinyl tub chairs and low partitions (top rd frosted glass). These are showing some signs of wear - quite uncomfortable. In one corner  cubicles with back-facing massage chairs and a beaded curtain for privacy. First Class area is the just a cordoned off back corner separated by a sign several plants. Food/beverages well below par. Tea preparation is separate from coffee. Array of teabags you find in any chain hotel room - only milk UHT. Coffee from machine worse than instant and tepid. Arrived at pm. Food almost depleted yet to be restocked. Tried a tomato/iceberg lettuce/hummus sandwich but it'd been so long it was in it's plastic bag it'd become soggy and the bread curled. Signs indicate hot vegetarian options where carrot soup and mashed potato. Several hot stew looking dishes and several Asian options. Six pcs with good internet speed. Along the entire window length a row of desks with individual reading lamps. Hospitality staff are pleasant. Female toilets:  cubicles  showers  hairdryers. Soap dispensers are the plastic type you buy in a supermarket. Extremely disappointing! I'm popping downstairs to grab a bite to eat.,2,-1.015756808
Dave Houlihan,What a contrast to the terminal  lounge last July and the new lounge in Terminal  by gate . The new lounge is spacious high quality furnishings great bar plentiful supply of food. Only negative is that it appears to be quite focused on Indian hot foods. Staff very attentive didn't use the spa. I guess the previous reviewer is a st class customer and would expect a separate lounge other airlines. A huge improvement and is matched to the excellent lounge in Dublin. On Etihad you normally get redemption seats which you never get any more with Emirates.,5,1.333657488
Michael Collins,This is the only part of Dubai airport which is worth visiting. The lounge is comfortable there was a very wide selection of good hot and cold food drinks etc. I would be happy to revisit this place if I ever return to Dubai - but that isn't going to happen - one visit to Dubai is enough for anyone.,4,0.550519389
K Lakshmanan,Brisbane's Emirates lounge is pretty decent. We arrived late from Singapore en-route to Auckland. We had eight hours to catch our flight to Auckland so we decided to get comfy at the lounge. We were welcomed at the reception given a tour of the lounge and recommended a cozy corner to sleep. There were four showers well stocked with timeless spa products. After a morning shower we had a light breakfast. Internet speed was fine. The best part about the lounge is that you can board your A from the lounge itself.,5,1.333657488
H Dalem,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet. It is a huge lounge because it covers the whole building.,3,-0.232618709
Finn Murphy,Etihad have closed their existing business and First lounges in Terminal  and opened a new combined lounge (no separate First) near Gate  in Terminal . First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for  minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here. I believe that when they renovate the old lounge area near the shops it will be a dedicated First lounge which will hopefully take the pressure off in this lounge. Poor experience overall.,2,-1.015756808
J Martin,Terminal : Arrived in 'Business' lounge at . Every seat was occupied. Busier than a bus terminal and about as comfortable. Screaming children added to the misery. The lounge is way too small to seat the people paying a big premium for their ticket. Other bleary-eyed travellers were circling the lounge looking for seats constantly. Shag-pile carpet looks dirty couches worn and grubby. Unsatisfactory.,2,-1.015756808
Harish Pachipala,The moment I walked in I could see it was crowded big time and it was hard to find a place to sit. It is /th smaller than emirates lounge in Dubai. Food a good spread and very efficient staff. Quiet room spacious but sleeping on couch is always painful for a tall guy. Washrooms cramped to the core and very small.,3,-0.232618709
G McIlvain,This is a poor lounge. The environment is out if date and the snack offering is cellophane prepacked stuff.,3,-0.232618709

Grant Hosie,Generally I fly with Singapore Airlines and now I know why. The business lounge although enormous was missing decent toilet and shower amenities. That is a huge disappointment and something you expect when flying business. The toilets were dirty and extremely run down. The showers were horrible and that's if you could be bothered waiting in line to use them. Completely disappointed by the new terminal business lounge.,2,-1.015756808
A Born,We did this lounge in Jan  EY to KUL. One of the worst I ever been in space wise. I had to give my stool to a furlorn standing lass with a cup of coffee in her hand. My first on Etihad and what a disappointment for the hub airport. The lounge was so overcrowded. Will be travelling J again as Etihad are value for bucks but shall be researching for a alternative airport paid lounge for a convenient place to sit. Staff were doing the best they could given the incompetence and short sightness of Etihad. What a downer on Etihad offerings.,1,-1.798894906
Scott Wales,Abu Dhabi Lounge Terminal . From the moment you get the lift/stairs to the entrance you feel like a Number. You don't feel special or the dollars you spent on a ticket was worth it. Its too busy Lounge is too small. The spa is brilliant as well as showers. I cannot fault customer service. The biggest problem are size of the lounge way too small. you feel cramped and enclosed. It didn't feel like a Business Class lounge of quality ie: Singapore Emirates Qantas British Airways.,4,0.550519389
A Al-Najdawi,Fantastic service and extremely nice people. Love the food and the care of the lounge staff.,5,1.333657488
P Do Valle,Excellent Lounge. The food court is separated from the main sitting Area. Business center (internet etc) in a separate area. Decoration is a bit austere making the lounge looking like a bank! The men's bathroom was totally run down. One of the faucets had an out of order sign and so had one of the shower rooms. Looking into the shower in operations was totally run down with humidity patches on walls.,4,0.550519389
E Stier,This lounge is huge for this little number of passengers of one A in Munich. Very clean. A lot of different possibilities to sit or work. In the afternoon they offer a fantastic range of cold and hot food with a great selection of wine and other drinks. Champagne as well.,5,1.333657488
M Niekerk,"Flying Australia to Ireland (or any number of European destinations) means you leave from creaky old terminal  when you change in Dubai. The Business Class lounge here is dreadful: shabby overcrowded and noisy. Going the other way you leave from Terminal  a new purpose-built A terminal. The lounge is almost as long as the terminal - departure gates for Business Class passengers are in the lounge. Not having to trek through the main concourse is a pretty good convenience. I arrived at the busy time just after midnight and left after a long layover at the next busy time just before am. In between the lounge was quiet spacious and very comfortable - especially the quiet area with loungers at the far end. (There were no PA announcements to disturb me for six hours as there were no flights). Even at the busy times the lounge wasn't crowded. There are two food service areas a lounge- like space on the left and a restaurant area hidden on the right with proper tables. Food and drink was okay in both areas if not inspiring. If you have a long layover at terminal  its worth using this lounge in terminal  and give yourself  minutes to get to the other terminal by the underground rail shuttle. One warning about Dubai Airport: ""duty free"" is a nonsense concept. The airport is a big shopping mall where everything is vastly overpriced.",4,0.550519389
H Schmidt,This lounge is over crowed. No peace area. Lots of screaming kids. Very limit selection of food and drinks. Atmosphere is a sort of darkish. In general uncomfortable. Not to be recommended.,1,-1.798894906
L DeLuna,The food and beverage selection was very extensive with several a la carte items offered. The staff was extremely courteous and eager to please. One employee in particular Nerlita went above and beyond to make sure I was well attended and provided superior customer service. I travel a lot for work and I have had the opportunity to visit many lounges- this one tops the list.,5,1.333657488
D Crookes,Just relaxing in the Etihad lounge and the service is excellent as usual. The staff are helpful and friendly and nothing seems too much trouble. The quality of the food is amazing and I'd have no hesitation in recommending this lounge to others.,5,1.333657488
G Nock,The Business class lounge in Dubai is vast and has a similar feel to a motorway service station. There were plenty of seats available and a decent selection of drinks. A big minus is that there are not enough toilets available for the number of passengers.,3,-0.232618709
Scott Waterfall,This was a great lounge with plenty of food and drink. The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for me.,5,1.333657488
P Waters,I use this lounge when departing from Birmingham as I am a Gold Skywards Member. I find this lounge to be an excellent start to any trip with Emirates. It is large spacious and the food on offer is always good. It ranges from snacks to hot or cold main meals with delicious desserts. A very adequate range of drinks is also on offer. The staff are extremely courteous and service is efficient and unobtrusive.,5,1.333657488
J Kneijber,Etihad use the SATS Premier Lounge in T at Changi. We had six hours in this lounge and found it to be better than a lot of airline lounges we have used. Greeted by friendly staff at reception. A huge selection of food was available that was well presented and kept fresh. Choices available from the bar were not so extensive. Staff cleared away dishes promptly. Clean washroom facilities. Excellent WiFi.,4,0.550519389
D Rogers,One of the worst lounges in an airlines hub city you can imagine. The lounge is very small and was packed with people at pm  more people were coming in and simply walking out  of us eventually found a lounge chair but there was no real reason to be there. The toilets are very limited food selection was average at best and biggest problem is screens showing flights we could only see one which was only giving details in Arabic (even Tehran airport VIP lounge that Etihad uses has screens in two languages). No sign of any TV or other entertainment was in view in the corner we were located The internet was rd world standard slow. As we left we noticed they had opened the door to the first class lounge which had not a soul in it. Maybe there are quieter times but this really lets down Etihad's inflight standards.,2,-1.015756808
Paul Dollymore,Due to our  departure the lounge was not as busy as at other times of the day. However seeing this serves Etihad's T I can see how it's facilities can be put under pressure. There was no a la carte food offering just a hot/cold buffet. I asked a member of staff if they could make a little something up for our baby daughter and they obliged. In addition my wife asked if there was any dessert wine available (as there is on the plane) there wasn't but the gentleman behind the bar arranged for a glass to be brought through from the First Class lounge. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was very good. Unfortunately the children's room was not up to the standard of Heathrowe. Finally on using the baby change facility (disabled toilet) after washing our hands we discovered we could not dry them because there was no hand towel in the holder or hand dryer or paper towels.,3,-0.232618709
Sabrina Falhaber,"As an EVA Air Business Class passenger I spent some time at the Aspire Lounge  before my flight to Bangkok. The staff were friendly and professional and kept the place very clean. The lounge is very light with large windows overlooking the tarmac. There's a variety of seats including lounge chairs. The food and beverages are ok, but nothing special. I'd like to see some more options in snacks and non-alcoholic beverages like for example a variety of juices. There is a pay for shower available but I didn't use it. WiFi connection was easy and good. Overall it was a comfortable experience, a little improvement on the catering would give it that extra touch.",6,2.116795586
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Very disappointing to be honest. The seating and service from staff was great but like the business class lounge at this airport it was very noisy because the general concourse and duty free area on the floor below is open to both first and business class lounges in the centre and the noise travels up and in. The food was marginally better than the business class lounge but to get toast and butter you had to go into the dining room sit wait to be served and then wait for the toast. All a bit over the top. Toilets and showers were exactly the same as in the business class lounge. Champagne was a little better I was told but the diet coke tasted just the same.,4,0.550519389
G Jones,No towels for showers. Food is pre prepared salads and sandwiches. If you are booking a flight out of Rome choose another carrier.,2,-1.015756808
T Collier,Gate B lounge an extremely busy lounge even at midnight. Due to its design it was hard to see where empty seats were located so literally sat down in the first one I came to which wasn't particularly that comfortable. It was near a bar though and the staff there were very efficient in serving you. Empty glasses/bottles quickly cleared away by the waiting staff. I couldn't see where to get proper food so can't comment on that one. Toilets kept very clean and tidy. Good speed for wifi also. Gate A lounge a much better design/layout than its Gate B counterpart. While still busy there did seem to be a choice of seating available. Easy to see where food was being served and the breakfast items were ample. Staff here seemed to be going for efficiency than friendly. Unfortunately I couldn't get connected to the lounge wifi but managed to get connected to the general airport wifi for  precious minutes. Toilets spotlessly clean.,4,0.550519389
P Dollymore,Plenty of space and facilities. We travelled on the : departure to Abu Dhabi with our seven month old daughter and made use of the (sound-proofed!) children's room. We had the a la carte breakfast and recommend the eggs benedict and pancakes. Hot and cold drinks regularly offered. There was a buffet with all the usual staples. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was a nice touch. Overall one of the better lounges we have used.,4,0.550519389
Nigel Gates,We used this lounge when travelling on Air Malta flights. London Heathrow lounge is excellent and in the opinion of my wife and myself is on a par if not better than the BA First Class (Concorde) Lounge at Heathrow T. On entering the lounge we were given a warm welcome. We were there on a weekday morning between . to .. There was an excellent breakfast (buffet and a la carte) with almost anything you could want. We found the spa in the to be readily available for chosen treatments. Although there is not a self-service bar for alcoholic drinks in the lounge there is a bar where passengers are served with alcoholic drinks. We have used the lounge twice (both times when travelling Air Malta Business Class) and have found the lounge and staff to be first rate.,5,1.333657488
James Choochot,Very large lounge but with limited refreshments on offer. Spa closed. Lots of staff cleaning tables but no table service. Soft drinks and beer available in fridges. Free wifi. If you want alcohol there is a small bar at the right hand side of the entrance which is easy to miss but they had no vodka left with no offer to replenish it. Wine served in half a glass. Quite disappointing lounge although it was quiet.,3,-0.232618709
Edwin Wahjosoedibjo,"Very nice Star Alliance lounge at LAX, with outdoor patio that has a fireplace. Ample seating. Nice decor. Available shower rooms. Food selection varies every time I visit but there is one staple: Vietnamese noodle (if you know how to mix it, it's great eats). Other food items were a bit below other international business/frequent flyer lounges. Wifi is available and fast enough to stream video or support VoIP phones. Flight status and current local time displayed in multiple places. Staff welcome at entry, but it be nice if they could smile. I recommend that you arrive earlier to LAX so you can enjoy the lounge.",6,2.116795586
Stephen Lloyd,The lounge is newly refurbished and very modern with some designer blue lighting in thick strips (akin to the starlights lighting on the aircraft) variety of seats including bucket high backs that I used. The lounge was long and thin quite crowded at first which gave the staff a task when many moved on as one leaving a lot of tables looking messy. The drink and food range is fairly standard for this airport - but did add some hot food over the Thai lounge offerings. Nice no problems but not exceptional.,4,0.550519389
M Smyth,Small lounge with small selection of food and drinks but these are good quality. If you want the packs of Walkers Shortbread biscuits be quick as the Chinese grab these in handfuls and stuff them in their carry-on bags.,4,0.550519389
Maurice Cross,I look forwards to visiting the Emirates lounge in Zurich Airport. Long walk but excellent food and wine. Average sized lounge but long trek to find it - however it is near the usual gate. One of the best lounges I have experienced. What a shame that they do not just buy a wifi modem and offer a decent service rather than that provided by the airport.,4,0.550519389
Keith Sanger,Emirates Lounge in Hong Kong is small but never seems too crowded. Excellent choice of food hors d'oeuvres etc. Soft drinks beers Champagne wine. And the staff will make up a sandwich for you if you wish. HKG doesn't have fast track for business class. But not a problem. The problem with HKG is the arrival. Didn't check showers or wifi.,5,1.333657488
Moira Allen,Absolutely appalling. Very disappointing to find that Emirates is associated with this lounge. There is hardly any food except a small bowl of salad or a stale sandwich. Is this really the service we expected when choosing business class with one of the so called top airlines of the world? Makes you think about booking Emirates again.,2,-1.015756808
James Choochot,Table service for drinks and hot foods. Waitresses very attentive and polite. Only serving one flight so quite quiet lounge. Small buffet area for mezze cheeses etc. I had cream of celeriac soup with mushrooms and truffle oil! fillet of cod with black olive tapenade root veg purÃ©e and vegetables! washed down by several well-topped up glasses of champagne. Restaurant quality in taste quality and service. Own toilets not shared as in the other lounges there. A great start to a holiday indeed. Cannot be faulted.,4,0.550519389
Mark Wilkins,Accessed as part of Gold card member benefits. The drink choices are high quality (excellent sauvignon blanc) - my only minor gripe would be the starter on the dining menu was slightly below the normal standard but an excellent main and dessert. Fast wifi good selection of papers plenty of seating make this my favourite lounge.,5,1.333657488
Brian Corrigan,An excellent lounge probably the best for choice and quality of food. Abu Dhabi is the worst very overcrowded limited selection of food but staff good.,4,0.550519389
G Graham,We had the opportunity to use the Eva Air lounge in Taipei during a layover to Hong Kong. Eva Air has four lounges here - Star Infinity Garden and the Club. We went into each lounge and ultimately settled in the Star Lounge. Each lounge has its own atmosphere and style. The Star and Infinity lounges are connected with the same reception desk. Plenty of food and drink options are available along with showers in the Star and Infinity lounges. Seating is abundant and comfortable. Wifi is available. I was very impressed with the regular cleaning of the washrooms and lounge. The staff was very friendly and professional.,5,1.333657488
D Bokr,At first a bit difficult to find. Signs are not well posted within the airport building. The lounge is light and spacious. Ample seating and good reading material. Flight departure announcements are made in the lounge. Catering very good. An excellent selection of Chinese Thai and Western foods. Bathrooms clean. Free internet. Staff are quick at clearing empty plates etc from tables.,4,0.550519389
D Bokr,Menzies Lounge at Amsterdam is the lounge that EVA Air uses for its business class passengers. This lounge needs a facelift. The seats are old saggy leather ones. Newspapers are creased and wrinkled. Catering is next to nothing. A few triangles of Dutch cheese with crackers and pot noodles that you add hot water to. One white and one red wine and the usual beverages. It lacks atmosphere. It is a real let down.,3,-0.232618709
H Jagannath,Business Class lounges in Concourse C - clean luxurious superb service excellent amenities great food wine drinks and juices. The new Business Class Lounge in Concourse A is a mega lounge with several mini-lounges and integrate boarding gates within the mini-lounges. Concourse A is for the use of As and has  gates. While there is a main dining and lounge area the idea is really to go to the mini-lounge area closest to your gate. Each mini-lounge has a wonderful spread of food drinks coffee machines wines etc. The food is great. Four vegetarian and four non-vegetarian options and salads breads and appetizers. There is a place to take a shower and it has all the amenities. There is also a Timeless Spa [paid I think]. The lounge is designed to seat close to  people.,5,1.333657488
Roger Purdie,The best Emirates Lounge that I have visited. Relatively small the staff are welcoming and helpful no matter. A superb selection of drinks and hot and cold food is backed up by efficient clearing of plates and polite staff who make the stay as comfortable as possible.,5,1.333657488
J Kuhn,It seems there is a new lounge under construction in the B terminal. The temporary lounge is a hot mess. It is just a section of the upper floor of the airport that has been blocked off to give a pretence of a lounge. It is loud (constant airport-wide announcements.) hot poor ventilation and messy. The staff are spread out over too large an area and cannot cope with the scope of effort required. Dirty plates cups and tables abound but the seat-hungry business traveler doesn't care and takes any port in a storm. Emirates should have brought on extra staff but chose not to. The staff are friendly but management is asking too too much. The lounge in the A terminal is in good repair and should be used instead of the B terminal. Waiting at the actual gate is more relaxing.,2,-1.015756808
Mark Wilkins,The buffet food choices were more varied and better quality than last visit - thai green curry and chicken in red wine sauce were both very good. For a pay on entry lounge (I access as Etihad guest gold card holder) the drink brands are always good quality - using Johnny Walker Green label as their standard mixing whiskey (something of a waste but not complaining!). The main problems with this lounge is that it does get very busy at peak times and woefully inadequate bathroom facilities. Good wifi newspaper selection and bbc world news on tv.,4,0.550519389
Thierry Itsara,Shower and toilet can become a nightmare. Just one shower and one toilet. No cleaning between guests no waiting list - if you want to take a shower you'll have to wait in line in the toilets! A nightmare! Wrote several times to Etihad probably others did never saw an improvement. Make sure there are towels before you start!,2,-1.015756808
L Grady,Visited this lounge on  different occasions in last month. It is by far one of the worst I have used. On a number of occasions I had to sit on the floor due to overcrowding. Etihad have two lounges here and both are as bad as each other. There is no booking system for a shower so it can be impossible to get one. Others mention the food as being great - I disagree food on the plane in business class is far better. The staff are good. In my travels with Etihad I would say that their Dublin lounge is the best I have used so far. You can order proper meals there but you cannot at their home lounges.,3,-0.232618709
P Lee,The lounge was relaxing food was good although they need more western style food. The staff was friendly and the lounge was well lit. Also the lounge was clean and there was usable wifi.,5,1.333657488
G James,Warm welcome from staff. Very large lounge but somewhat impersonal. Not a lot of western food available. The showers were brilliant kept clean by a nice staff. They were really shower suites with a miniature bedroom attached with wardrobe vanity unit and dressing shelf. A joy to use.,4,0.550519389
H Jones,Untidy and in a very poor condition. Very crowded extremely poor selection of drinks and snacks. We just about managed to get a seat together in a cramped windowless corner and had to step over the lead of the lap top for the man next to us every time we got up. The toilets were in a poor condition as were the lounge seats. The staff barely cleaned the tables and seemed more intent on finishing their conversation in the kitchen area. The receptionist didn't even say goodbye when we left. I couldn't find a newspaper or any other reading material. Will not use this lounge again at LHR.,2,-1.015756808
D Olsson,"Sprawling lounge with excellent food and drink but it was crowded even at midnight. Major design flaw in that the designated ""quiet zone"" packed with lounges and beds is the noisiest part of the lounge with very loud announcement speakers and noise from the terminals below. Very difficult to get any sleep in the lounge even after midnight.",4,0.550519389
Ros Cherry,A nightmare - a long queue to get in and then - ten minutes queue for the ladies toilet. A big queue for coffee and snack. No free tables/chairs. Used plates everywhere not cleared away. Noise level dreadful. No chance of getting a shower for a couple of hours. If you can avoid.,2,-1.015756808
David Rennie,An excellent lounge with plenty of seating a wide range of good food and reading material free wifi and proximity to gates.,4,0.550519389
S White,Lounge provided for gold and silver frequent flyers available for other airlines and payment. Small dull normally overcrowded uncomfortable and inadequate toilet facilities.,3,-0.232618709
J O'Connor,Food is great and bar staff are friendly and efficient. The problem is that it is way too small to handle the passenger flow. Can be difficult or near impossible to get a seat. Toilet facilities are very cramped and totally inadequate for the number of passengers they have to handle.,4,0.550519389
C Zugaj,This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. The staff was vaguely interested the food choice very limited and very very average. There was no shower gel nor shampoo in the showers the shower mixer was broken resulting in nearly boiling water pouring from the shower head. When complained to the head of the staff I heard that how could they no if guests did not report implying there is no cleaning between the guests! All together terrible experience despite very good service on board though. Will not come back again.,2,-1.015756808
S Wardle,This lounge is a shocker for their home base Eva Air need to do something to improve the standard. Food and drink was pretty poor I had a  hour stopover at this airport so I got to know this lounge all too well - if I never go back that will be fine with me.,2,-1.015756808
Kevin Tsai,Itâ€™s much better than the old airport but there are still lot things that they could be improved. For instance food section could do with more selection of hot food and drinks also can be provided with more variety. Massage chairs were great and easy to use as well. Noticed that they have installed a shower but it wasnâ€™t a very high standard one and it looked very shabby and basic . Only got two TV monitors of flight info on both sides if you want to check your flight info you have to walk a little bit to get it as itâ€™s a very long lounge could have installed more TV monitors in the middle.,3,-0.232618709
Ernest Barger,All new modern design good selection of food and drinks. Food changes during the day. Away from the other lounges but near EVA boarding gates. Very clean bright and comfortable.,4,0.550519389
G Nock,We used the first class lounge twice recently and one of the best lounge experiences we have had. We had a late night snack of Sushi and drinks outward and a Champagne Breakfast on the return. Both were excellent and served by efficient staff. Boarding was direct from the lounge which was excellent.,4,0.550519389
G Nock,The lounge at Birmingham is quite new and well run with a decent selection of food and drinks. Generally a pleasant and comfortable environment to spend a few hours waiting for your flight.,4,0.550519389
Nina Khan,My rd time but this time everything changed and downgraded. As per previous reviews I was very disappointed with Dubai Business Lounge very overcrowded no hot food meal options only cold buffet snack type foods.,3,-0.232618709
David Lowe,Very attentive and friendly staff restaurant food plenty of it great wifi and comfortable seating. Showers and bathrooms spotless.,5,1.333657488
H Bereaux,Used the Etihad Pearl Business Lounge at Abu Dhabi T while connecting from a MCT-AUH flight to AUH-MAN in business. Between these two flights the lounge was a huge disappointment particularly with this being Etihad Airways home airport. The lounge was crowded so there were no comfortable seats available the food was okay but lacked choice (four of six hot options were available) - and the toilets were filthy.,3,-0.232618709
M Benjamin,Further to my previous post Sep  this lounge has improved. It's still an awkward walk from T to T but I was pleasantly surprised how improved the lounge was. There is now a newspaper and magazine rack the food selection now has a lot more to offer including cold cuts of meat and various cheeses. A bigger selection of hot ( warm) dishes various teas and coffees and a lot more seating arrangements ( previously the middle and lower tier sections were closed off ) . The washrooms are a little small but a hot shower is available. A well stocked bar with waiter service is a nice touch. On a minus note there didn't seam to be any computers available. Overall a very pleasant experience and would recommend to all.( shame you still have to walk into T for a smoke though).,4,0.550519389
Y Leung,The airport lounge is long and narrow but not overcrowded. The business section has internet connection but no computers unlike the EVA lounge in Hong Kong Airport. WiFi is free however. Seats comfortable and lounge is clean. The food is passable but not excellent. I would expect the lounge in EVA's home base to be more elegant.,3,-0.232618709
Y Leung,EVA Air flies to Newark only three times a week and does not have its own lounge. Its flight departs at  pm and check-in begins three hours earlier. However the business lounge operated by BA only allows EVA passengers to enter after : pm and attempts at early entry would be stopped by a British Airways staff stating that this is their agreement with EVA. The lounge is small and crowded and can barely accommodate all the EVA passengers. I hope EVA could negotiate with BA to accomplish a better terms of agreement so that passengers could use the lounge at least two hours prior to departure of the plane.,2,-1.015756808
Wade Lindqvist,Crowded and with poor access. Staircase or one very busy elevator. Very limited food but drink options quite ok. Not really anywhere to relax and check in can be too time consuming. Finnair know how to do it properly with their their Non-Schengen lounge. Why they offer this product is strange considering the airline itself continues to improve.,4,0.550519389
S Callaghan,Shabby crowded poor catering. Overall very disappointed with the complete experience. Showers looked shabby and water was cold on both my outbound sector and inbound.,2,-1.015756808
S Freeman,What a Dungeon! Never expected this from Emirates. To pay almost K on a ticket and to be thrown in a lounge that has no natural lighting is overcrowded with limited selection of food and drink is disgraceful. One bite of a sandwich that was stale and we packed up and walked out. We felt much better sitting around like randoms in the general airport area.,1,-1.798894906
Mark Loader,"Still a few teething problems but they are trying hard. Signage is difficult to find so everyone has stopped at the first seating area which is packed - while the rest of the lounge is quite empty. Also the constant boarding announcements for flights departing other parts of the airport are bit annoying - they should only announce flights in Concourse A. The lounge ""looks"" great but is a bit style over function. For example tables are difficult to sit and eat at chairs not too comfy.",4,0.550519389
Johan Vranken,In terminal  about  minutes walking from terminal . Have always found this lounge to be clean and less crowded than the actual Etihad business class lounge in terminal . Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Same food and drinks as in the business lounge.,4,0.550519389
D Lancaster,"This is the Air New Zealand lounge shared by Etihad. Who on earth decided to use wickerwork rattan armchairs for the ""comfort"" of travellers who sometimes have to spend hours waiting for a connecting flight - the armrests alone are uncomfortable enough but add in the punishment to the seating area penetrating through the cushion. The only other viable seating is of a benching type so no armrests - but on balance preferable! The food choices were very limited and as such I was not hungry enough to assess the quality.",3,-0.232618709
G Tonge,If you are a silver or gold card holder flying in economy class this lounge is now allocated to you. However this lounge is located in terminal  and as most people transit in terminal  I don't think it's worth the + minute walk to use what is generally a sub standard facility. I wouldn't pay to use this facility and would rather sit in Starbucks at my own expense.,2,-1.015756808
Y Leung,EVA has its own lounge within a bigger one shared by a number of other airlines. It was empty when I entered the lounge for my afternoon flight to Taipei. I was greeted by a very charming lady who gave me a menu of light lunch with two or three main courses to choose from. I used the computer which has excellent internet connection. The meal arrived and the girl set the table nearby and the wonton soup I order was excellent. In general an excellent experience.,5,1.333657488
Simon Welch,Very poor. The selection of food and drink was poor and had evidently not been updated for a long time despite the main flight of the day leaving an hour later and the lounge being little used. Very little sign of the staff and overall a somewhat depressing experience.,1,-1.798894906
Graham Rudd,What a poor lounge - for the main hub for an airline you would expect they would make every effort to roll out the red carpet and make it a memorable experience.,2,-1.015756808
Wade Lindqvist,"Spacious, comfortable and relaxing lounge. Reclining chairs with views are pleasant. Food is just ok while the drink options are fine. Very short walk to all non-Schengen gates. So much better than the Schengen lounge it is hard to believe it belongs to the same airline.",6,2.116795586
Petri Hottola,Visited again the lounge on the th of November for four hours before a domestic flight. Unfortunately instead of improvements the service had gone worse. No food despite the new space- consuming meal service tables. Not a single copy of the newspapers I normally read there (Herald Tribune Iltasanomat) even though they were sold at general news stands at the boarding area. Waiting lines for the dirty toilets despite the fact that the lounge was half empty. No place to hang one's coat at the toilet (middle one for disabled passengers). A section of the area closed for passengers. Lots of staff but very little service for us frequent flyers. It is a shame that the Finnair 'home base' lounge is like this even though the international lounges are ok.,2,-1.015756808
Alan Ward,Nasi Langsar was cooked on request and a fantastic Malaysian meal prior to boarding. The staff were friendly and extremely professional.,5,1.333657488

Bruce Curry,The lounges at Heathrow and Colombo are excellent. At Heathrow boarding is direct from the lounge which is comfortable. The food and drink are excellent. In Colombo the lounge is very relaxing. It has an excellent range of food and drink and service could not be better.,5,1.333657488

N Cambourne,Extremely disappointing. Limited choice of food In fact there were on two varieties of tuna rolls on offer along with corn chips and pretzels. Nothing else. My wife and I were traveling to Sydney and had a four hour layover between connecting flights and while the peace and quiet of the lounge was welcomed the lack of food was not.,4,0.550519389
B Degener,I Visited this lounge when connecting from Asia to a Schengen destination. Access was via stairs with a significant amount of way traffic. The frontdesk area was rather congested as was the food and drink area. It was very crowded so to leisurely pick a food and drink choice with also carry-on luggage to worry about was no option and therefore I settled for some orange juice. That as such was fine for me: I don't visit a lounge for food and drinks anyway (as there is decent food on the business class flight that follows) but I do visit a lounge for some peace and quiet and since there where very few comfortable seats left but an awful lot of traffic instead there wasn't much chance. Also too few facilities in the men's room also here was a small queue forming. I must add however that this was my st and only visit to this lounge and the time of day may have been a factor (around : local time) so it may be better at a different time of day. But in my opinion it is not capable to sufficiently cope with the amount of visitors that I saw during my visit.,2,-1.015756808
B Degener,While connecting from Amsterdam on a flight to Asia I had plenty of opportunity to wait in this lounge and I can say it was very comfortable. Food and wine selection was more than sufficient as was the seating capacity. But what I personally enjoyed the most were the wonderful recliner seats with a nice view over the apron.,4,0.550519389
Petri Hottola,The lounge was closed for three months for a renovation without alternative service or compensation for number of Finnair frequent flyers (Silver card holders). After the renovation the standards have unfortunately dropped in a significant way. The two main problems are: Instead of two access routes only one is left (one set of stairs and one elevator frequently reserved for maintenance purposes). As a result long waiting lines to the lower floor delay and frustrate customers. People have to stand on the stairs for up to  minutes to check in. The meal & snacks area has become too congested preventing access to the food and drinks for both the customers and the staff. As a result you grab what you can or what happens to be left while trying to avoid stepping on too many toes. The staff struggles to keep the area clean and organized for the same reasons. Add boring selection in regard to hot food and salads (well everything,,
J Dock,Had to wait hrs for connecting Emirates business flight. Lounge large but not enough toilets and not very clean either. Long queues which I would not expect in business class lounge. Wondering how Emirates manages when they are ordering so many new aircraft and cannot cope with the present business class lounge.,4,0.550519389
Philip Stratton,Citibank and AMEX offer the use of this lounge as a benefit to having their cards but it isn't much of a benefit when you can't find a seat to sit in. I have used this lounge in the past and it has been pretty handy. The last time we couldn't find anywhere to sit- not that it bothered the staff at all. People often hold empty seats for others with their cabin luggage that remain empty for hours. Other people use it as a hotel and sleep on two chairs. The Wifi doesn't work very well although there are some computers there that are popular. The food and beverages on offer are pretty good but the one shower needs a makeover and there seems to be corrosive gunk on all the fittings in the washroom that really should have been taken care of years ago. The furniture has taken a moderate beating and has been there since day one. The concept is great but it has become a victim of it's own success needing refurbishment enlargement and some better standards.,2,-1.015756808
Gilbert Isaguirre,The lounge was too far from the terminal. The food was not really that hot. The fruits and beverages was ok. The staff told us wifi was going to be fixed soon but I waited for almost  hours and still none. Accommodating staff great six sense spa offer but it was so limited - I was only allowed to use  treatment instead of at least .,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Taynton,This lounge is overcrowded and very noisy. Food good great service but we were there from  to  and it gradually got worse with a number of people standing up and not being able to get a seat at all. I do not agree with the idea of asking people traveling in economy to use another lounge. I will in future organise my connections so I can limit time in this lounge.,4,0.550519389
Trevor Young,Pleasantly surprised by this lounge. Choice of various styles of seating. Plenty of hot food choices which was good as we had a five hour layover. What was exceptional was seeing a chef testing the temperature of the food in trays. I have not seen this before anywhere and many times endured cold offerings even in so called first tier airlines. Most impressed with Finnair for this.,5,1.333657488
M Aylward,"This was our first visit to this Lounge - what a disappointment! We arrived just after  hours and were looking forward to some nourishment before our return flight to the UK. But the only food on offer was a vegetable soup with cheese some limp brown chopped up lettuce tasteless beetroot - the potatoes tomatoes cucumber and coleslaw were all empty! To make matters worse there appeared to be no one on duty to replenish these dishes. Even the apple cake had dried out! Very disappointing considering it was the height of the lunch hour. The drinks were plentiful and varied. As others have said the lounge had obviously been recently refurbished but all the Loungers on the upper level and the comfortable seats were occupied leaving just ""plastic like"" moulded chairs and tables? Not the best! To make matters worse an hour later saw an invasion of passengers for the far east and when we went to refill our glasses - as if by magic - suddenly there was Minestrone soup a hot chicken and rice dish hot dogs a selection of fresh salads a selection of breads and fresh fruits. Sorry Finnair but my fare included the entry price to this Lounge I we were entitled to parity of service - which we certainly did not get.",2,-1.015756808
K Singer,Used the Non Schengen Lounge for our late night departure ex Helsinki. The Lounge was clean and very comfortable with plenty of choices for Drinks both Alcoholic and Soft Drinks. As this was the last flight for the night there were only a few limb lettuce leaves and Soup left so if you planned to Eat before the flight you would be very disappointed!,4,0.550519389
M Larder,The Dubai Business Class lounge is not big enough for the number of passengers using it so it is difficult to find a seat. There are long queues for the toilets. If you have more than a couple of hours in the lounge then it feels a lot lot longer as the seats are not good for relaxing with very few foot stools. The food options are limited. At least there is free Wi-Fi.,2,-1.015756808
A Kirkpatrick,This shared lounge is very poor. Although there is enough space (a small room allocated to Emirates First Class) the food and drink selection is small. Food is not made to order and runs out quickly. This lounge is shared by so many airlines and card holders that it does not feel special. As a First Class passenger I feel the old lounge shared with South African Airways was so much better. Sadly this has now closed.,3,-0.232618709
Toby Masson,Quiet comfortable and relaxing. A good variety of hot and cold food and excellent selection of beverages. It is enhanced by the fact that all of the EK flights from Gatwick are Bs (rather than As) meaning that there will never be more than  people in there at any one time. The reception staff are helpful and wait until the queue at the departure gate has cleared before calling the flight meaning that you can leave the lounge and get straight on to the plane.,5,1.333657488
Mark Wilkins,As a silver card member I'm entitled to access to the Al Reem lounge at Abu Dhabi. I can't compare it to the Pearl lounge in T (I've never accessed it) but as a business class lounge it was good with plenty of breakfast options available stocked and manned bar area plenty of seating (if in a somewhat weird  tiered room) and newspapers and magazines available. However Wi-Fi was unavailable whilst I was there (and the staff couldn't fix it) and there was only  staff to man the bar clear plates and update the breakfast area and thus they struggled to keep up with demand in a less than half full lounge. The only real problem is the lack of toilet facilities in the lounge for its size.,3,-0.232618709
Mark Wilkins,Small but uncrowded lounge. Quality of service food and drink during my stay was excellent. Free wifi and tv/newspapers available. The criticism would be the lack of a sleeping zone but few lounges of this size would be likely to have that. Definitely much better than either the Al Reem lounge in AUH.,5,1.333657488
M Benjamin,Previously Etihad gold and silver card holders used the Pearl business lounge in terminal three complete with comfy seats and smoking room but now (due to overcrowding) have to use the Al Reem lounge in the old terminal . All Etihad flights to Europe and Asia arrive and leave from the new T so this becomes awkward. On arrival you have to bypass security and walk ( mins) to the old terminal and the lounge. This lounge is not a patch on the T lounge with a very limited food selection (drinks are fine). There is no comfortable seating area and no papers to pass the time. The next problem is there is no smoking room so you must use the smoking room in the far corner of T. Then of course to catch your flight head back to T and go through security which becomes more of a muddle if another flight arrives as you do - as nobody knows where they are going and can cause another delay.,3,-0.232618709
N Singh,Beautiful lounge but lacks in the food category. We each paid  euros and thought it might be a good alternative to dinner but at :pm there was no dinner in sight and no real food other than salad soup and bread. Lots of drinks available but in general quite disappointing due to no other food/ snacks available. Wouldn't recommend it if you are mainly looking for a meal and drinks.,3,-0.232618709
Antony Miller,Helsinki was cold grey and closed it being th Night public holiday and so we resorted to a long wait in the Finnair lounge. Catering is quite simple but delicious much better than having endless choices of tepid offerings you don't want. Staff charming couldn't do enough. The lounge large and calm. Lots of Finnish understated design and the raised area with the recliners is the height of deliciousness. When it is crowded the centre can be a little canteen like but crowds are crowds and the staff do a brilliant job.,5,1.333657488
K Hirst,This is the best lounge I have been to in Australia/New Zealand there is very little to fault apart from the distance from customs/immigration. Great food with enormous selection of both hot and cold choices and friendly but unobtrusive service. Good selection of reading material. Natural light and views of the tarmac and gates with very comfortable decor. Bathrooms top notch. with great amenity kits and more than adequate business facilities. Added bonus of being able to board your flight direct from the lounge.,5,1.333657488
Trish Loughman,Overcrowded hot and not really that pleasant. The food on offer was nice enough but the crowds of people made me want to get out of there fast.,4,0.550519389
Trish Loughman,So much more pleasant than the crowded horror that is the Business Class Lounge. The First Class Lounge is an oasis of calm. Excellent food staff and facilities.,5,1.333657488
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Quite a small but pleasant lounge. Nice reception from the staff and frequent offer to refill drinks and so forth. As it was an early flight we enjoyed a cooked to order breakfast. Very good. You could also help yourself to cold cuts and bakery if you didn't want a cooked meal.,4,0.550519389
B Watkins,"We were flying First Class Etihad-Europe having previously travelled First Class on Qantas BA Air France and Emirates. The lounge turns out to be the New Zealand Airlines ""standard"" lounge. This is very much not what we expect when we pay for First Class. It's a nice enough lounge crowded despite a quiet night at the airport (I'd hate to see it on a slightly busy night!) but nothing more. Would not reach Business Class standards for any other airline. As we sit in the lounge we are not planning to fly Etihad again. There's a chance for catch up on the flights and in the other ports but really we've made a decision to fly First Class because we want ""First Class"" funnily enough! This is not a First Class lounge and as stated above I'd be disappointed if I'd paid Business Class for this. Part of the real pleasure of starting a holiday is sitting back in the lounge with that first glass of champagne. We last travelled Emirates and while they didn't have a dedicated First lounge (shared with Business) the facilities food and champagne are great on board. This is the first time I've ever bothered to write such a review which reflects our disappointment. Etihad has a fair bit of catching up to do at this early stage. There's no way that we'll depart Melbourne with Etihad again. Do what Air France do escort your First Class passengers (in CDG at least) to the lounge make sure they're comfortable and come and get them when it's time to leave. If you're going to ask for - times the fare make the customer feel a little special!",2,-1.015756808
Diana Wright,Etihad business class travellers have to fight for seats in this lounge. This lounge is too small and regularly too full to accommodate all business class passengers. Food quality has declined.,4,0.550519389
E Barday,The most uncomfortable chairs in a lounge I've been in. Not relaxing at all! Whoever designed this lounge is a designer - not a business traveler! Very limited selection of food that did not look attractive at all. A few cheap wines and some beer.,2,-1.015756808
F Felstead,Unimpressive. Low slung Scandinavian furniture - all style no comfort. A five hour transit ended in a sore back. Food supplies are meagre - a few limp salad leaves and a lacklustre pumpkin soup. Plenty of alcohol but not much to soak it up with. The place is littered with dirty crockery and glassware - the attendants only cruise by every now and then to clear it all away. No soap in the women's toilet and the men's urinal (I'm told) smells. Expected better. This is one of the most frugal lounges I have been in.,2,-1.015756808
H Kohler,There was not much food a few salad leaves that was it bearing in mind that the lounge was half full. The toilet was dirty. Considering that this is the flagship lounge of Finnair. You can really see cost cuttings in that lounge. This lounge has not much to offer.,2,-1.015756808
S Kazim,The location is convenient in terms of being next to the boarding gate but it is a trek away from the shops etc. The lounge is a common one for first and business class and has ample seating. The display of food is impressive and the it is all halal. Toilets and showers available as well as free internet access. Overall an excellent lounge.,4,0.550519389
Ravi Mene,The lounge is smart with comfortable seats but air conditioning was not on and the lounge was very uncomfortable. A group of passengers got very loud and were becoming a distraction and disturbing other passengers. When brought to the attention of the staff they were not interested. Food and drinks were adequate several TVs.,4,0.550519389
David Minard,Pleasant comfortable lounge. Ai conditioned unlike gate lounges upstairs. Good selection of small food and beverage. TV internet showers if required. Shared with other airlines but not crowded when we were there.,4,0.550519389
David Crabbe,I have used the Flybe lounge in Edinburgh twice the past few months. It is a dismal place with threadbare furniture and minimal facilities. Hardly know why they bother with it.,2,-1.015756808
David Crabbe,I used the Flybe business lounge back at the beginning of October . It is even more minimalist and threadbare than its Edinburgh counterpart. You wonder why they bother with it in the first place if it cannot be made brighter and more welcoming There is a washroom out the back but the advice is to use it only if you really need to for it's in the most dreadful and dilapidated state .Pretty poor show the whole thing.,2,-1.015756808
Zafrullah Hamzah,Totally disappointed by this so called premium lounge. Not only was it overcrowded the staff offered no help when you are circling around trying to find a place to sit and eat. The staff at reception was fine. The toilets seemed too small for volume of passengers and I looked for the so called shower facilities in vain. The whole design on top of the huge crowd using it certainly gives you the impression that you are in a canteen and not in a premium lounge. On the return flight the plane from Kuala Lumpur landed in Abu Dhabi around midnight and not only trying to find the lounge from where you got off this time was a nightmare but when I got to the lounge I did not bother to eat (despite being hungry) as I was not prepared to explore every corner just to find a comfortable place to eat. Etihad please wake up and upgrade this lounge I am not being demanding but when you pay to travel business class some comfort in transit is not too much to ask.,2,-1.015756808
Tayab Chinyoty,Senses Spa would be one of the best things here. Lounge is too small for the morning traffic. Food was good and a variety. Staff is too loud. Waiting for the shower and a line for the toilet - never happened with me before in a Business class lounge. Etihad people need to understand what a lounge means - and not just free food and drinks.,3,-0.232618709
A Swensson,The few dishes that are offered weren't replenished at my visit. In some cases I was met by an empty serving tray of a few odd pieces of crumbles. Drink section was extremely dirty with a lot of spills that weren't cleaned up. The soda machine was leaking. Seating area was better cleaned but I already felt uneasy from the food and drinks section and left soon. There are other lounges in HEL airport maybe better chose another one even if it means you need to pay for your entry.,2,-1.015756808
A Swensson,Very noisy as the lounge was filled over its capacity. It was not the relaxing place you want between flights. Stylish yes. But I found it to be stress-inducing not relaxing. The spa-section mentioned below is closed for good and the lounge offers nothing out of the ordinary. In fact it doesn't even offer the ordinary. The food sections cannot be called a food section. It has some cookies and sodas. There is a bar with a very nice bartender but the drinks offered were of the lower quality. If you like food and decent drinks you need to pay extra.,2,-1.015756808
Andrew Pickles,Lovely calm Nordic feel to lounge. Unfortunate that they did not plan it in a part of the airport with views of the runways. Views of air bridges are not inspiring. That said the facilities are great. Apple computers Marimekko and Iitala crockery - very stylish. A much improved food selection which I would have liked to have enjoyed more of but saved myself for inflight meal HEL-SIN. Comfortable seating and a choice of tables and chairs lounge sets or recliners.,4,0.550519389
N Riordan,Were pleasant and comfortable. A good selection of snacks and drinks available along with a fast internet connection. Staff were attentive and it was a good experience.,4,0.550519389
K Franklin,The first time I have used this new lounge and a great improvement from the shared lounge that Emirates used before. The lounge is not that easy to find. It is located near the arrival desks on the left hand side via a lift to the rd floor. Once found it is clean only thing missing is a smoking area. Food excellent but limited choice of drinks but for Sri Lanka this is heaven and compared to the shared lounge is a real treat. Staff friendly and helpful.,4,0.550519389
David Hooker,Severely over crowded queues for showers and wcs. Noisy and as previously described like a street market. Not what we expect as a business customer. Didn't bother attempting the showers on the return leg. Enough of a problem to over ride any of Emirates' other benefits.,2,-1.015756808
Stephen Taynton,This is not an Etihad lounge as they do not have one at JFK. This lounge is so poor it is unbelievable unhappy person on reception only one person cleaning up the food way below lounge level no champagne warm white wine. We left as soon as possible. Avoid this place it really is very bad.,1,-1.798894906
Vincent Greene,Rather small feeling crammed and very crowded. It was difficult to find a seat and impossible to use one of the computer terminals. Staff were busy in their attempts to replenish food and beverages. The lounge needs to be much bigger.,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Taynton,Although this is the new lounge in Terminal  it can get very crowded. Food and beverage is good but seating is a little close together and there is not much privacy. The Six Senses Spa is great. Overall not a bad lounge but I do not know why Etihad chose to create such a small lounge in contrast to the number of people who use it. Etihad needs to attend to the washrooms as they were not what you would expect from a business class lounge.,4,0.550519389
Jan Willem Pronk,This is the much heralded Finnair long haul lounge in Helsinki. Finnair flights from Europe and Asia arrive and depart within a few hours time frame in the afternoon. meaning the airport and in particular the lounges fill up during those hours. This new VIA lounge has a pleasant and light northern-european design but still feels a bit claustrophobic because of the number of people and the high-density seating. Staff welcoming and free Wifi available. Food and drink situation however not great. Limited choice and low quality (wine from a tap for example). The spa section is free for the highest status members of the Finnair FF program but not for the same level One World frequent flyers.,3,-0.232618709
Matt Adam,Not really up to scratch in terms of space or facilities. It feels like an original frequent flyer lounge from when they first appeared twenty years ago. Limited computers and inadequate toilet/shower facilities.,3,-0.232618709
C Smith,Far too small for the number of passengers. What idiot calculated that  urinals would be sufficient for the hundreds of male passengers? Queuing in the cramped sweaty lavatory is NOT what you want after a  hour flight from Brisbane. The whole lounge is a disaster area and quite a joke after reading the Emirates web-site description.,3,-0.232618709
A Wilmot,Use the lounge about twice a month. It is now becoming apparent that it is not First Class. The wooden furniture is damaged (chipped and scratched) and the upholstered furniture dirty and worn. It is very noisy with all the announcements from the departure hall below and this lounge must have the worst wifi on the planet. The staff are friendly and helpful and selection of food and beverages are generally good. However I found the Lounge in T (currently closed) far more superior giving a much greater feeling of elegance privacy and exclusivity. It is much smaller with almost no sound interferences.,2,-1.015756808
Richard Hodges,Stopped off here on our way to Auckland in Feb . Very pleasant lounge with selection of snack foods and drinks. Very attentive service who supplied good coffee as and when required. Quite a few people in but still nice and relaxed. When our flight was called we more or less boarded straight from the lounge - nice touch.,4,0.550519389
Stephen Taynton,The a la carte dining was superb with great attention by the staff. Again the Six Senses Spa is great and just what you need before a long flight. The food and beverage section is well maintained and is of a high quality. Overall this is a fine lounge and rates as one of the best I have been in.,5,1.333657488
A Mendoza,Excellent catering and drinks selection complete with bar service. Abundant large screen iMacs for use as well as Wi-fi. Well-kept though few toilets with a single shower so there can be a queue. There is a Six Senses Spa which gives complimentary  minute treatments with free clothes pressing. Inside the Spa are  more showers. The rush hour seems to be from - am. It was virtually empty before and after that.,5,1.333657488
Richard Hodges,Used this lounge twice March  on our way to and from New Zealand. Quiet spacious and clean with endless supplies of beverages and food and restaurant area. Very comfortable sofas if required. Excellent facility well worth using except why are the showers outside the Lounge? And why are the toilets separate from the showers ? You have to exit and walk quite a way before locating the Shower Room (which frankly could do with sprucing up).,4,0.550519389
B Wijesinghe,This is a new lounge a huge improvement. The facility was immaculate and offered nice views with comfortable chairs excellent food separate dining area well designed toilets and business centre. Lounge staff attentive and friendly though the reception staff member on duty seemed more interested in chatting on her mobile phone than being attentive.,5,1.333657488
D Minard,A new lounge we did not know existed. Very Welcome .Staff very welcoming. Everything clean and spotless and food and beverage selection excellent. Good scenic views of the Bosphorous and airport.,4,0.550519389
I Comyns,Outstanding staff and first rate food and beverage. The bathrooms offer hot showers. Free wifi and champagne with canapes was an ideal way to start a flight.,5,1.333657488
R Tang,Transit time around . hours and went to main Business Lounge. Not too difficult to find seat for  people. Internet speed is extremely slow which I had to give up eventually.,3,-0.232618709
Sonia Thomashausen,Probably the dirtiest lounge I have ever been to even touching the fridge door to get a drink was unpleasant. The carpets are dirty the available cutlery not clean tables were not wiped old plates with dried food and drinks everywhere. Rubbish baskets overflowing. A soup was available some time during the day but the dish was practically empty with dried left over in and around it. A couple of sandwiches in plastic and some apples. Coffee no tea. Water and coke and  more soft drinks were available. Toilets smell bad broken and only one had a bit of toilet paper.,1,-1.798894906
O Moore,Apart from the fact it's too big and impersonal there are only two shower rooms and the wi-fi is ridiculously slow. Brisbane has as many showers for only  flights a day. It's enough for me to move to another airline.,2,-1.015756808
M Brindle,Compares more than favourably with the Air New Zealand lounge. Pity there was no info on joining Skywards and the lounge staff gave us incorrect info which resulted in us not being credited with miles for the flight.,5,1.333657488
J Grimes,I normally use the main business lounge but a  minute walk from the main transfer area came across this smaller lounge near gate . I arrived at  and found only  other passengers there. Food and drink selection seemed good. Excellent wifi. Quite a long way to walk to my gate - however more than compensated by this excellent little lounge.,4,0.550519389
A Nielsen,Disappointing experience. In spite of reasonably good food and a spacious layout the Emirates T lounge disappoints - at arrival at AM in the morning seating was widely available but around AM passengers clearly surpassed the lounge's capacity. WiFi became slow and signal dropped repeatedly access to basic food required waiting in line longer than acceptable toilets and showers were constantly full. I support other reviews about the inadequate layout of bathrooms and showers - the lounge is simply not good enough for a -star airline when showers and bathrooms do not have cold water water pressure is pesky and you have to wait in line for a free bathroom.,3,-0.232618709
K Franklin,I was very impressed with the service and food - well run clean and enjoyable visit. A shame they do not use the same food and quality on the planes.,4,0.550519389
Margaret Smith,"Whilst this is apparently still a temporary venue, it is an insult to passengers who've paid good money to travel Business Class. What makes this seem even worse is that most Garuda flights to Australia leave Bali very late in the evening. Customers arrive at the lounge after a late checkout from their hotel, feeling tired, looking forward to catching a few hours sleep on the 'flat bed', it is reasonable to assume that they may wish to enjoy a few quiet drinks and a light meal before hopping onto the plane. There are some single armchairs, no tables for putting food/ drinks on, very few power outlets, poor reading materials, no private areas, with the food choices/presentation befitting a canteen. Luckily I had read that it was possible to get a wine/ beer if you know that you must ask for it.  This is all such a pity because the actual flying experience is very good and quite comparable to other airlines charging similar prices for their premium travel.",1,-1.798894906
Katherine McWhirter,Who in their right minds would not put toilets in with the shower facilities. You go to have a shower - then you walk in thinking you would go to the toilet first. You are then told toilet facilities are down the hall somewhere - outside the shower facilities. This must have been designed by a lunatic. The food is nothing near as good as the old business class lounge. Usually it is cold and dry - in the numerous times I have used this lounge the food has been really dreadful. Very disappointing.,3,-0.232618709
K Franklin,I have used this lounge about  times this year. As a smoker I thank Emirates for providing a smoking area. The staff were excellent - I have yet to try the A la Carte dinning as I only spend about one hour in the lounge. I would like to have trolleys for passengers when leaving the lounge as sometimes its a long way to the gates and secondly a larger selection of drinks.,4,0.550519389
N Sutherland,LGW is by far the better of Emirates London airport Lounges and the food was better than their DXB Lounges (which is not hard) or any of their SE Asia Lounges. Excellent food and drinks choices several TV's plenty Internet access a very spacious and comfortable lounge with professional and courteous staff. Excellent all round.,5,1.333657488
Jo Hogan,"Absolutely ridiculous that this lounge is still a temporary lounge - the airport has been built, restaurants are open other lounges have been open for more than six months and Garuda  still haven't got their act together. I'm told that Bintang isn't available till pm? Maybe Garuda should consider giving a refund to compensate travellers who have paid for business class expecting service - or team up with an open Lounge the other airlines have done. It's not rocket science. And even if Garuda insist on keeping the temporary lounge, at least provide a decent service - it wouldn't kill you.",1,-1.798894906
Zeng Yixie,The lounge have lots of facilities and is overall satisfied. with plenty of seats nice view to the airside friendly staffs. But air-conditional not always working the lounge is a little bit warm. The lounge does not have much food to eat but with enough kind of drink. I went for shower two times (I booked return trip) the first time the shower room it have no shampoo gels or even towels but the second time it was just like an  star hotel room which is tidy and with all the things i want.,4,0.550519389
Melinda Gorringe,This is definitely not a business class lounge there are no toilet facilities - you have to use the public ones. Food is ok but wine is below average and you have to chase a staff member to get a wine or beer. We keep being told that this is a temporary lounge but no one can ever tell us when the new lounge will be ready - the new airport has been open some  months now - how long can is possibly take. It is disappointing as the facilities onboard in business class are very good with the Lounge in Denpasar being the only let down.,1,-1.798894906
Candice Shah,Very nice new lounge for Emirates at the Mumbai airport. I think it is the first dedicated lounge EK has set up in India. In the past Emirates biz/first passengers used the Clipper lounge at Mumbai airport shared by many other airlines so this is a welcome change. Used the lounge around  am while waiting for my : am flight to Dubai. Not to crowded took a seat some reading material and got a cappuccino. Separate dining and seating areas. There were Indian and international breakfast items available in the buffet but somehow it seemed to early to eat and had a nice business breakfast to look fwd to on the flight so skipped eating here. Decent bathrooms with  showers also a nice touch. Toiletries and towels available.,3,-0.232618709
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Emirates have produced a lounge of exceptional comfort and service. The new lounge offers comfortable seating good business services and excellent food and drinks - the style follows Emirates other lounges.,5,1.333657488
Kevin Tunnicliffe,It could be a good lounge is a little more thought went into it. I have got over the vastness of it and strange layout meandering over the first floor of the terminal. The downsides are the overcrowded and impersonal greeting at the reception the poor shower facilities and slow internet service. Upside is the good food and extensive beverages on offer.,3,-0.232618709
J Carson,I have seen the business class lounge a few times and whilst the staff are nice and food is okay the rest is overcrowded with poor showers and very limited seating at peak times. Now I use the First Class lounge and what a difference. Restaurant style dining beautiful shower rooms nice TV pods. Staff okay but the aircon is switched down and you need blankets to keep warm!,5,1.333657488
Tim Holmes,The lounge cannot qualify as either a Business or certainly not First class lounge and should not be promoted as such. Food is at best basic dipping to appalling. No alcohol served unless asked for then only beer and wine and not promoted. They have been promising a new lounge for  months. The old lounge in the old terminal although sub average was better. No shower or restroom given  star to both bar and restroom only because I can't submit without adding a score!,1,-1.798894906
J Mcmyler,Transit of  hours after arriving in from Australia to connect onto AMS. Lounge extremely warm one half closed off until close to pm. Food terrible alcohol hidden behind a bar never saw any staff member there finally helped myself. No towels in shower asked reception however nothing happened. Major gripe was after asking if I could pay to upgrade to first class was told they could not help me and I would need to go to cashier which is located landside. Therefore I was expected to clear customs to access this. Why couldn't they pick up the phone and ask? Major difference in staff compared to the inflight cabin crew who were outstanding in business class. Not impressed at all.,1,-1.798894906
Mark Cowell,We arrived at am and found a very nice space in which to spend an hour or so. Its not an intimate lounge and the toilet count is poor but it is generally light and airy breakfast food court was excellent and the flight announcement was well timed.,4,0.550519389
Mark Cowell,Its a fair trek from the main T concourse but once found was a very nice space in which to spend an hour before boarding. All the facilities one would expect including an excellent and well serviced food court and bar. Very helpful and attentive staff. Direct boarding of the aircraft from the lounge was the final bonus.,4,0.550519389
J Singh,Disappointing - felt the lounge in the old terminal was better. In the T lounge no comfortable areas to sit - tip go to the furthest end of the lounge in front of the kids area as its quieter there if you need to rest. A very confusing lounge - certainly not a business lounge at all more like a waiting room with free food - which costs you the price of a business ticket!,4,0.550519389
Tony Hall,Domestic departures was through the old domestic arrivals area. Business lounges for both domestic and international flights were fenced off parts of the main concourses with no computers available. No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one.,2,-1.015756808
Tony Hall,No alcoholic beverages are available (or at least not on display). The domestic lounge had very worn furniture with rips in some of the upholstery. The domestic lounge had a shower in the mens toilet which I used but only cold water.,2,-1.015756808
Isabel Pritchard,Very disappointing. Difficult to find somewhere to sit chairs not comfortable for long waits food disappointing - I am not into stew and casserole type dishes at am not very much on offer only muffins. As with other parts of the airport only hot water dispensed from taps in rest rooms had to go and get bottled water so that I could clean my teeth. Some serious thought needs to be given to the layout and service.,3,-0.232618709
M Spratley,It was spacious clean bright well air-conditioned with ample seating a wide choice of good quality food and drink and helpful staff. It is vast and if people take the trouble to walk beyond the initial seating area they will find ample seating at both tables and of the armchair variety. During the  hours we spent there (from .am - .pm) we sat in a section of the lounge (approximately  arm-chairs and a 'cafeteria' area of approx  chairs) with only  other people.,4,0.550519389
Graham Clark,Very impressed with Lounge facilities food/drink presentation and Staff. Makes for a great start for a long flight when you can relax and enjoy quality pre-flight ambience. This was our introduction to Emirates and we were very pleased with the experience. Have since tried other Lounges in Dubai and Paris and would rate the Brisbane Lounge as the best.,5,1.333657488
Charles Sirapandji,Lounge is spacious and lots comfortable chairs. Internet speed is good but the choice of foods are limited. Although for some passengers food may not be the things to look for but I like to try local foods and due to time constraints in certain country lounges may be the last place to try and have some local dish.,4,0.550519389
Charles Sirapandji,Lounges set up was nice lots of lights. Because of this lighting which is good but it has disadvantages - generates heat and room temperatures becomes warmer. Staff are very friendly and helpful although they need further training. Supervisors and Lounge manager should be try harder to make this lounge to be among the best.,4,0.550519389
B Owen,This is still a temporary lounge which is simply partitioned off from the rest of the terminal. Didn't have and food or drink. Lounges comfortable but only just enough available. As it is really just a part of the main concourse it suffers from the continuous announcements. Not really relaxing but better than the main terminal I guess. Will be interested to see what GA comes up with once the terminal works are complete.,2,-1.015756808
Brent Anderson,I have been in terrible lounges in some terrible airports that are quieter and better laid out than Emirates Terminal  lounge. I have on some occasions chosen not to even use the facilities as they are so poor. I take the walk and go back to the old lounges in the older terminal. At least it is quieter and does not have a hundred people queuing for every service.,3,-0.232618709
Anthony Stekelenburg,The lounge is combined F & C class and quite spacious with lots of seating options. A warm welcome by staff at the front desk. Lots of food options as well as Champagne. Bathrooms were clean and tidy. One downer is that there are no windows but this is the way AKL airport is set out. When ready for boarding we were escorted to the gate and the airbridge to the upper deck. A very nice experience.,4,0.550519389
Anthony Stekelenburg,A nice and cosy lounge similar to AKL but with windows. Morning departure so I didn't sample the booze but the espresso was excellent. A lot of reading materials staff friendly and welcoming and escorted us to the gate when boarding. Is it just me or are the Emirates Ground Staff doing a better job than their cabin crew.,4,0.550519389
S Marinus,Much better than the old lounge in the old airport but very different what they tell you on the web site. Only beer and vodka available. Food extremely limited. No service. No lounge toilets and have to use public toilets outside. Nice comfortable chairs.,2,-1.015756808
Keith Wiggins,An excellent lounge every bit the equal of Emirates lounge at Gatwick. If anything the food quality was marginally superior to Gatwick.,5,1.333657488
M Mainwaring,A badly designed linear cafeteria which is noisy and stuffy. There appears to be a deliberate attempt to minimise the amount of comfortable seating. As for the showers there aren't enough of them for the volume of passengers and the water is limited to a trickle. The old lounge was marginally better than the new one. Compared to the Emirates lounge in Gatwick and Singapore this Dubai lounge is a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
P Cook,Garuda Business Flyer so went into the separate part for Business Class not much in way of food or beverages sitting where everybody who walks past to departure lounges looks in. Better off paying and going to the Premier Lounge.,2,-1.015756808
Annalisa Greene,Lounge was very small with comfy chairs that were now quite dirty and stained. Food selection poor. Magazines and papers were available at the door and there was a tv. Lounge staff announced departing flights. The  female toilet was very dated and had a dodgy lock.,2,-1.015756808
Annalisa Greene,The lounge was large with a variety of comfy chairs. There was a quiet room that had a  seater couch and other small chairs and tables. There were  computers and lots of powerpoint/recharge points for laptops and tablets. The food selection was good although I felt there was more on the Asian side and as I am a bit finicky I was not so fussed. Lots of drinks and hubby was even given a refrigerated glass for his beer. The facilities were very clean and tidy as was the bathroom shower. There was a shower but there did not appear to be any towels and when I commented on the shower to the bathroom attendent but there was no mention of clean towels forthcoming. The staff were fabulously friendly. Our flight was delayed  hours and the staff passed around blankets and as it was late they turned down the piped music and dimmed the lights.,4,0.550519389
M Powell,Dreadful place. arrived at am to find people sleeping across comfortable seats covered with blankets. I complained about this to a security guard and he said they shouldn't be doing it and he would wake them up. Joke. About an hour later I went to the desk and told the girls that this was unacceptable and they again said it was not allowed. But I pointed to one chap who was in their line of vision who had been sprawled out when we arrived and he was still there. They said they would go round and wake them up. We left to board an hour later and he and others were still asleep. My neighbour complained about this happening a month ago and got a reply from customer services saying this sleeping across seats was going to be stopped. Obviously has not. Where have all the people come from who now use this lounge?,1,-1.798894906
R Cole,This is simply the worst Business Class lounge I have ever used. It is a chaotic mass of economy class over-spill. I had a  hour wait for my flight during which time I expected to relax complete some work and enjoy some quiet time. How wrong I was! On entering the lounge % of seating was occupied with people fast asleep draped over the settees and arm chairs all surrounded by mountains of hand luggage. A number of strategically placed screaming babies adding to the feeling of misery which was soon to be magnified by the stampede of bodies pushing and shoving to get to the main snack area and fill their plates with as much food as possible. Poor manners and attitude appear to be the accepted norm within this facility and you soon realise there's not much difference between here and downstairs on the main concourse (In fact Burger King was quieter!). Another side issue is the Wi-Fi facility - My dial-up connection in  was far far quicker! I pay a little extra to enjoy a little more exclusivity and comfort offered by Business Class - it's non-existent at Dubai's Emirates Business Lounge in fact to be accurate it's awful!,1,-1.798894906
Paul Kernig,Lounge full no room to sit - very noisy. Toilets a disgrace staff totally unconcerned. Really disappointed with this terminal.,1,-1.798894906
J Freeman,Lounge isn't really Business Class quality and it doesn't give much privacy. At the time I entered the Lounge there were many children running around. Food selection not very good just cheese sandwiches.,3,-0.232618709
S Lubis,This is one of the best Lounge at Jakarta airport nicely designed with comfy furniture with views over the apron. Free wifi and workstations are available. As my flight to Bangkok is in the morning they served breakfast with egg stations with live cooking plenty of toast juices coffee/tea and plenty of reading materials.,5,1.333657488
Carole Clements,This was our first time in the new T Business lounge and it was a disappointment. It didn't feel anything special and was quite crowded. The lounge just doesn't feel like a business class lounge - more like a waiting room. We didn't see much food on offer just hot / cold drinks muffins fruit ice cream. We didn't want to lose our seats so we didn't really get to see a lot of the lounge or what food might have been on offer. All in all not the best in business lounges by a long shot definitely needs some re-thinking and re-planning.,3,-0.232618709
Carole Clements,This was our second time in this lounge and it was just as good as the first visit. Lovely spacious lounge with lot's of good comfortable seating. The choice of food was good with a selection of hot & cold dishes plus snacks coffee & full bar.,5,1.333657488
S Avant,In fact its not a lounge for Business Class ticket holders its a lounge for anyone with $. to spend on entrance. The lounge was old worn out and full of people who had paid the $. for the privilege of a good TV free booze and snacks. Can't blame them but there was no place to sit so we stood outside.,1,-1.798894906
S White,As soon you clear customs when departing you will be approached by Garuda employees offering you access to the Garuda Lounge for $. rph Take my advice and jump on it. We all paid the $. rph and headed in. Bintang on tap spirits food tea coffee and free internet access on their computers. Staff ask you what flight you are on and will let you know when its last drinks and time to board. Worth every cent.,4,0.550519389
Reykard Van der Yong,Lounge is located in right in the front of entry way from check in rows so it is easy to find. The selection of food is quite vary mainly Indonesian fare but there are some western style selection as well. Beverages selection quite plenty with beer available as well for free of charge. The lounge can be quite crowded in the morning and late afternoon. Bathroom were clean with staff kept going around and cleaning them. Staff were very helpful but they need to improve their English to serve their non Indonesian customers. Overall the lounge is very good compare to European standards.,4,0.550519389
M Rego,The Smiles lounge in Terminal  Rio de Janeiro (GIG) International Airport opened in  as the VARIG main lounge in Brazil (Smiles is the name of Varig's frequent flyer program now with GOL Airlines). At that time it was the best South America lounge and was used by Star Alliance (Lufthansa United and of course Varig). It was an outstanding lounge with separated areas for first class and business class showers smoke room plenty of reading materials excellent beverages and high quality food. In  Varig went out of business and GOL acquires Varig routes mileage program and VIP lounges. Strangely as GOL uses the Terminal  they continued using these lounge in Terminal  so it is impossible to board a GOL flight and use its own lounge. The lounge is used by a lot of airlines (Lufthansa United US Airways Diners Club card menbers among others). The good part is that as a big lounge it never get crowded they have good (a bit used) furniture and luxury res trooms. Unfortunately the first class section is now closed the drinks offered are cheap and the food minimal.,4,0.550519389
Patrick DuPlessis,Visited the lounge  times in July. Not a bad facility - not the best but serves its purpose. Gets really crowded in the peak morning departure times but quiet at other periods. Staff quite friendly but not much chat with customers. A fair choice of hot and cold food but needs to be improved to match airlines such as Malaysia Cathay Singapore etc. Small smoking room area nice bar area at one end and  internet terminals = wifi not working when I visited the lounge. Washrooms very basic and the  shower room was so unpresentable that I preferred not to use it! Not bad for Garuda but they could so much better!,3,-0.232618709
W Nainggolan,Garuda Indonesia executive lounge is the biggest lounge facility at Soekarno-Hatta Airport. Located in Terminal E-F the lounge occupies an area of .m comprising a sq m domestic executive lounge with a seating capacity of  seats and a sq m international executive lounge of  seats. The new lounge offers an array of facilities - fully-equipped business center with meeting rooms and IT support a quiet room a refreshment area with shower nursery a luggage area and praying room. As opposed to existing lounges that cater to credit card holders the new lounge is reserved exclusively for the comfort of Garuda Indonesia's Business Class passengers and Garuda Frequent Flyer (GFF) Gold and Platinum card members or Executive Card Plus members.,4,0.550519389
F Weeren,Expensive is the first thing that comes to mind if you are not a member of Gulf Air's Golden Falcon FF program. The lounge charges access in chunks of  hours each and when you have a . and a  hour layover as I did that adds up. Sleeper seats at one end of the lounge but the lights have been positioned so as to shine directly into one's eyes and Gulf Air has to discover the concept of eye shades whether on their aircraft or here. The lounge does provide blankets and there is also a shower available to freshen up. While you will be told at check in that flights are not called the reverse is true - some flights are called (very disturbing to sleep when there are no earplugs available!) on a very odd seemingly random basis. The desk staff is obliging while service staff in the lounge tries to be unobtrusive but fails miserably clattering dishes and glassware making a lot of noise when replenishing food and drink etc.,3,-0.232618709
T Summerhayes,The Gulf Air lounge allows a 'pay per visit' for any traveller. I needed good wi-fi and some good breakfast. I paid Â£GBP each for the two of us. Very friendly staff and club lounge was immaculate with fast wi-fi. However at about .am the remains of what was breakfast was cold and congealed at the self service food bar. I asked in the form of a complaint about the state of the breakfast bar. I was offered a fresh coffee (very good) by one of the girls and told that when the chef returned from his break that he would prepare us some breakfast. This he did. We were offered a plain omelette or some 'fresh' frittata. We opted for the frittata. Two small slices each with no accompaniment. Very disappointing and not worth the money we had paid. Even with the wi-fi and a total of  coffees GBP was a lot to pay. Will not be going there again.,3,-0.232618709
Kim Thomsen,A nice little lounge located next to gate  in Terminal . Greeting was friendly and professional. Great views over the southern runway and the stands outside. Food and drink selection was very good but cannot quite compete with the Qatar Airways lounge. Small terminals with movies and series placed at most tables for entertainment.  Mac terminals with internet access if you have forgotten your computer and WiFi is available in the lounge as well. Very nice restrooms with showers if required.,5,1.333657488
Val Becque,Situated overlooking the tarmac the lounge is large and airy with an adjoining self service food area. The central bar has a full selection of drinks including fizz. Full selection of newspapers WiFi and smart toilets and showers. Loads of seats including a section overlooking the aircraft. Because of T layout it is still a - minute walk to your gate even though you can see it from the lounge. Ours was a morning visit and there was a wide selection of hot breakfast food on offer. Well staffed this is a good lounge.,4,0.550519389
M Bertram,Impressed by spacious and modern lounge in Bahrain airport. The seats were comfortable and able to get a view airside so we could watch the planes coming and going. The food was quite tasty and there was a reasonable selection.,4,0.550519389
B Rippingale,Used this lounge travelling with SriLankan Airlines. Very nice lounge which was refurbished and of good quality. Good selection of food and drinks. Staff were attentive. Showers were locked even though nobody using them not sure if this was because we were not Gulf air passengers. Toilets were clean. Wifi and computers available and seating including some comfortable chairs sofas and quiet rooms.,5,1.333657488
R Clarke,Clean bright lounge with a nice relaxing ambience with good food and nice selection of drinks. Great to use clean toilets and the staff very pleasant to talk and interact with. Internet was good as was the Wi-Fi. Gets a little crowded at night time though.,5,1.333657488
N Siotto,Excellent seating variety (it's possible to order a quiet room at an extra cost of  BHD). There's a good variety of hot food. It has a good selection of drinks and a espresso machine. Armchair equipped with a portable screen to watch a selection of movies. There's a family room with toys and a separate one for children and teens with XBOX stations. Free WI-FI. Clean toilets and courteous staff.,5,1.333657488
Dave Houlihan,What a contrast to their own lounge in Bahrain was fantastic on the outbound. They use a Service lounge used by number of airlines dark gloomy depressing. wireless involved sending your personal details and then a text to some number and after  tries never worked. Gave up in the end no alcoholic beverages at all. Some hot food but looked like it had been deep fried to its death and was verging on carbon. Staff smiling which is the great thing about Indian people always helpful and courteous. My Advice don't get to the airport to early and save hanging out in this lounge.,2,-1.015756808

Pam Williams,Comfortable lounge with darkened sleeping area at one end. Selection of food limited but tasty. Not self-service. You choose what you want and it is prepared and brought to you.Staff only too pleased to do whatever they can for you. Reasonable selection of drinks. Internet available in  minute blocks (but I went back for several without a problem). Ejected at  hrs as final Airport Security check closes shortly after this.,4,0.5505193893044773

G Becque,This is a haven of peace at T and certainly one of the best lounges at Heathrow. Although small it has a calm feeling and has full facilities including full bar with good fizz and tasty snacks. Full internet for those who need to work or perhaps relax under the drapes awaiting your call to board. Gulf will lay on a buggy on request and also you are encouraged not to go to the gate until called from the lounge so you can board last. Look forward to trying the * lounge at BAH and the soon to be refurbished Gulf lounge at MCT,4,0.5505193893044773
G Becque,GF lounge at BAH is the best I have encountered. From being met at the reception desk by the most courteous staff to being escorted to your gate if requested by the most profesional staff it is a truly enjoyable experience. Computers free wifi a huge choice of food from hot snacks to sandwiches drinks from the finest champagne to sodas. Staff will also pack you a lunch box for a long haul flight if requested - in this lounge you dont have to ask for anything as everything is offered. The lounge has an Arabian theme which is very comfortable. People often wonder what they are paying for with business and first class prices apart from the wonderful service offered on their flights this * star treatment in the lounge would put alot of * hotels to shame.,5,1.3336574878175844
Joel Chusid,New spacious lounge with comfortable chairs and sofas. A special area with massage chairs and TVs. Pod chairs. A business area with PCs. Plenty of outlets and flat screen TVs everywhere. Snacks hot (soup dim sum) and cold (salads sandwiches) and a variety of beverages are available with a central self-service counter international magazines and newspapers. Showers and clean restrooms. Toilets are high tech! WiFi works well. Flights are announced. Separate security checkpoint for first and business class and elite members provides entrance to the lounge which has direct access to gates. English proficiency of some staff was limited.,5,1.3336574878175844

Brett Kero,The lounge has undergone renovation to make it cleaner and a better layout. For frequent flyers it's a good lounge wife coffee soft drinks and packet nibbles for first or business it's not a good",,
lounge. No cocktails or hot food any sort of meals.

T Jacobs,Furniture appears to be from the mid s. Not comfortable. No private toilets. Has a soda dispenser and a few coffee thermoses. No TV showing flight status. There appears to be a desk for an attendant but no staff was seen for the two hours we were there. There is free WiFi but that's about the only reason to visit this lounge. It's worth noting however that the WiFi login page's certificate was expired.,2,-1.0157568077217367
W Bleeker,The lounge itself is clean and well maintained. Seats are comfortable and it provides a respite from the noise of the rest of the terminals. The lounge falls short on catering miserably. People who pay premium prices for first/business class service or for Premier/Pualani Gold/Platinum memberships deserve far more than juice packets pretzels and coffee which they receive in coach class flights. Especially when other airline club lounges offer much more in varieties of foods like pastries fruits hot/cold foods beverages including alcoholic beverages. Hawaiian should work on this.,3,-0.23261870920862976
M Barry,This has to go down as the worst airline lounge I have been in. The air was thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke it is a non smoking lounge. There is no food on offer not even a cracker and signs everywhere stating outside food is not allowed in lounge - offer some food if you don't want guests bringing it in. Coffee soda and juice are the items on offer. Very poor for a Business lounge Hawaiian Airlines should be ashamed.,3,-0.23261870920862976

M Carrick,Quite a nice rather small lounge positioned one level down from the main gate area. Staff were very nice and friendly when I visited and offered help for everything. Good selection of hot and cold food and wide choice of beverages wine etc. Managed to find newspapers ands magazines that I like found a comfortable sleep and relaxed for  hours. Lacking of shower facilities but I guess there is no room to offer this in the facility looking at the size.

Wifi was provided free of charge, and service was non-intrusive.",6,2.116795586

I'm sorry what can my family One of the poorest vip lounges I've visited. Dirty bathrooms and no amenities. Rude staff. BA - why do you bother with this lounge?,2,-1.015756808
D Chamberlain,Used this lounge as BA passenger. Really much improved my last visit here in May. The food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge. The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.,4,0.550519389
Michael Davies,A really nice lounge. Good view over the apron and runway. Plenty of seats - I was there mid morning. The food was excellent. Hot breakfast items still being served Well stocked bar with beer wine and spirits. An excellent coffer machine. Despite being a Spanish lounge in a Spanish city there were plenty of English language newspapers despite what other miserable people had previously stated. Some people should take a chill pill or get back to the public area. Timely flight announcements made allowing a relaxed short walk to the gate and straight onto the plane. Staff very friendly. A great experience.,5,1.333657488
R Vines,The lounge is large and quite good. The food and drink are acceptable. The absence of English-language newspapers is unacceptable.,3,-0.232618709
R Vines,"The lounge is OK but the food and drink in the passenger terminal are infinitely better. I'd rather pay for the ceviche and pisco sours outside the lounge than sample the ""hospitality"" within. I realize that BA and Iberia operate separately within the IAG but reputational damage is shared.",2,-1.015756808
H Rowe,Iberia only has business class (not first) and this is a really good lounge. Even though it was late morning and well after the peak breakfast period (but nowhere near the Spanish lunch hour either) there was a nice buffet that including Spanish omelettes smoked salmon assorted breads and pastries and fruit/veggies/salad. The beverage area was well stocked: everything from soda to tomato juice to wine. I don't believe they offered a selection of liquors but they had a lot of wine and beer options. The space is open and inviting bathrooms were very nice and immaculately clean. My only criticism is that despite the open layout and good amount of space actual seating was hard to come by. That lounge is busy and there really aren't enough seats.,5,1.333657488
A Simon,This lounge is located in the satellite part of terminal  where most long haul Iberia flights and a few other carriers such as British Airways (the airline I flew in this case). You can access this lounge if you are in business or first class on Iberia or another oneworld airline or have oneworld emerald or sapphire status through your frequent flyer program. So though it seems many can access this lounge it is not a problem as the lounge is needlessly large with two symmetrical wings accommodating many at a time. Overall this lounge was fantastic as it was very spacious and comfortable with areas to eat work relax and even a separate sleeping room with privacy dividers. The bar was well stocked and contrary to the Sala Dali lounge I used in the main terminal  this had a well stocked buffet with many different options. However I did not like that in this lounge you must ask for Internet cards from the staff at the reception where you scratch off and enter a c ode that you enter in your device. This would be okay but it only last  minutes before you need to repeat the process. That being said the Internet speed is very fast. The staff did a good job keeping the food and drink well stocked and the whole area well kept but while they got the job done they didn't seem as though they really wanted to be there. Overall this is definetly a nice place to spend some time before a flight and if I was eligible to use the lounge again I would definetly take the time to do so.,4,0.550519389
Roger Tilling,This is much bigger than the Velazquez Lounge at Madrid. It is quieter as well. There are superb areas offering wine and spirits as well basic sandwiches salads nuts crisps smoothies coffees teas milkshakes and juices. Plenty of newspapers and magazines (but it doesn't cater for English-speaking passengers in that category). There are internet terminals but they didn't seem to allow me to 'send' a message from them. Overall extremely impressive - if you had several hours between flights you would be comfortable here. There are just enough distractions and curiosities to pass the time in comfort!,5,1.333657488
Roger Tilling,The lounge is easy to find despite the enormity of Madrid TS. Once inside it is airy and spacious. There are shower facilities. The catering is very extensive - pasta salads meats sandwiches pre- packed salad meals olives nuts and crisps. It caters for short and long haul alike whatever the time between flights. There is a comprehensive range of wines spirits and soft drinks and very good coffee. There is also a separate restaurant for travellers on a night flight so that they can eat before their flight. The acoustics tend to echo a little but very good.,4,0.550519389
R Baldwin,Flew LHR-MAD-BOG: Saturday night connection through Madrid on  November. Lounge completely rammed no seats apart from a bar stool in the TV room. Food not surprisingly expired so a selection of boring dry savoury snacks. I forgot my BlackBerry charger and there were no charging stations.

J Phipps,To be clear there is a massive difference between the T and T South lounge so don't get them confused. T lounge is pleasant but the food and wine choice is poor. The decor is good and the toilets are trendy. Amazingly no wifi (what century are we in?). Computers seem to be powered by transistors. T South lounge great views friendly staff a wonderful red wine selection good food offering but again no wifi! Seating and general design good.

R Raines,Iberia lounges at MAD they have a sleeping room food and wines are respectable and Spanish the facility feels fresh and modern with some sense of design. They do however fail on one point which is that they are incredibly difficult to find the signage at MAD is terrible very confusing. Iberia staff seem to loathe English - the man who admitted me to the lounge looked pained by the act of speaking in English. This theme continued onboard in the business class cabin to LAX and no one but the purser will speak any language but Spanish - on a nonstop serving Los Angeles.,4,0.550519389
J Bacallado,Iberia offers a good quality lounge. Food service during breakfast lunch and restaurant for night flights. The rest of the day light snacks sandwiches and soft drinks/spirits. They offer a desk to try and learn about their wines of the month. The only problem no wifi only cable connection. Toilets showers in good condition. Also a rest area if you need some sleep.,4,0.550519389
G Lock,Before our outbound flight we used the lounge in TS. This was a pleasant place with several defined areas. Very light and bright with views across the airport. It was a busy time of day with many long- haul flights departing but there was plenty of room. A good selection of hot and cold food as well as drinks. The only thing I noticed lacking were the toilets - too few and not to the same standard as other OneWorld carriers. On our return we used the lounge in T. This seemed smaller but was still comfortable with a couple of unusual water features and views of the airport especially the impressive terminal roof structure. The food and beverage selection was noticeably more limited than in the TS lounge. We made use of the shower facilities which were very good apart from the fact that the hot water lasted for  minute. When I queried this the attendant informed me that the boiler was unable to cope when all  showers were working at the same time. A slight design flaw.,4,0.550519389
R Marsh,Very large lounge which spans a portion of the length of TS with great views onto the runway. Great selection of spirits wines and beverages generally. Hot and cold food (including smoked salmon) cereals fresh fruits and various nibbles. Not too busy comfy seats and internet facilities.,4,0.550519389
Rolando HernÃ¡ndez,The lounge although it has been recently renovated seems to be very small on peak periods. The staff is almost invisible. The available food depends on the time of the day but sometimes everything is empty and nobody cares. The bathrooms are very small and if you decide to go to the WC you should keep dancing all the time since the light detector will turn off the lights if there is no movement.,2,-1.015756808
Fabrizio Ferraro,I used this lounge as travelling on a BA flight. First of all It takes about half hours to arrive to the lounge as T Barajas is not a user friendly airport. The lounge is very spacious nice design fantastic view on apron and mountains the selection of food would have been decent if the trays had any food on it the wine bar would have been nice if more wine bottles were available to the public (we had to ask the staff to open a few as there were none left open). The computer area is just ok nothing much the relaxation room is perfecft for passenger who like that. There is a restaurant for intercontinental passenger but this is closed until late at night. Toilets and showers good. The reception staff was welcoming and helpful the rest of staff seemed to be very lazy.,3,-0.232618709

James Slocombe,VIP Sala lounge again disappoints. The general condition of the lounge is still average with a large seating area and a view (albeit obscured) across the runway. Some of the furniture is worn especially the chairs in the popular locations (near the windows). The TV despite being a large LCD is never really utilised - being tucked away in a corner on channel TVEspana without sound. When I asked to hear the TV (the normal lounge lady wasn't on duty today) the new lounge staff didn't speak English so I had to convert to Spanish. My Spanish is pretty good but I do expect the airport staff - especially lounge staff - to understand English and respond to me in that language if that is the language of my choice. It didn't set us on the right footing. I was told that sound would disturb others so she couldn't change the volume. So what is the point of the TV then? I asked. I got shrugged shoulders. I expressed my displeasure and walked off for a coffee. The coffee was cold. So I went back to the lounge staff. She solved the situation by taking my coffee to the kitchen and (I assume) putting it in the microwave. The cup was too hot to hold! Despite the coffee the bar/alcoholic drinks selection is superb. Even the soft drinks shine bright - Coke without caffeine Coke zero Fanta milkshakes fruit juices etc. all being stocked among the usual collection. By far the best collection of cold drinks in one lounge I've seen. However the food is dire. In fact it could be described as peanuts. Not even an apple or a rotting banana. Nothing except peanuts and a tea-biscuit. Compare this to the Sala lounge at TFN a smaller more regional airport serving mostly national Spanish routes and Tenerife North wins hands down. They even have small sandwiches and a selection of cakes at TFN - but in LPA no!,2,-1.015756808

Tony Dang,What a disappointment. Used this lounge prior to my morning flight to Madrid. Staff member at the front desk hardly acknowledge you as you walked in. Food selection was extremely poor nothing more than some stale croissants and some pre packaged mini muffins. Coffee from the machine was horrible. The two computer terminals were both out of order and so were the toilets. Does anything work in this lounge? Lounge was not used much by many of the travellers despite IB having numerous flights leaving around the early morning departure time at LHR perhaps the frequent travellers knew better than to waste their time.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Roger Stone,Used the Iberia business lounge at Frankfurt for their code-share Air Nostrum flights out of Frankfurt. Nice welcome and a good selection of magazines and drinks. I cannot quite get used to the largely European practice of having most washrooms separate from the lounge. At Frankfurt this meant a long precarious walk through an area of terminal refurbishment to a fairly crummy toilet. Surely it would be a good idea to equip business lounges with washrooms! Otherwise an odd little lounge but a reasonably pleasant overall experience and a place one could work.,3,-0.23261870920862976
R Crosbie,An excellent out of the way lounge. Warm greetings from all staff including the cleaners. Lockers with a key are provided for carry on luggage which offers a hands-free exploring of the lounge itself. Plenty of selection: sandwiches smoked salmon cheeses crackers chips as well as liquors wines and beer. Soft drinks water and juices are also available. Seating is very comfortable and widely accessible washrooms are nearby and were VERY clean. Way better than Air Canada's lounge.,5,1.3336574878175844
Andrew Ward,Visited this lounge on a Sunday afternoon - almost deserted. Comfortable seating and spacious airy atmosphere. No catering to speak of and poor drinks selection. Nothing to read either. Ok place for a bit of peace and quiet but otherwise very dull.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Idat Erdener,An excellent lounge with all imaginable amenities a silent room with sleeping possibility huge space a restaurant for intercontinental passengers who can dine after  pm (which could be earlier I know Spanish people eat late but not everybody does) a wine tasting corner shower possibilities (great) separate smoking areas etc. Only wireless internet could be also free of charge.,4,0.5505193893044773
DAVID VLCEK,Yet again after visiting the Iberia Sala VIP lounge at Barcelona airport it seems that nobody works there. After arriving in the lounge tables were overflowing with all sorts of rubbish glasses were not cleared for couple of hours lounge was full of smoke. One of the fridges which was not working  months ago when I was last in this lounge was still not working this time.,2,-1.0157568077217367
M Cooper,Lounge itself is nice. However travelers should be aware that access is denied if they are arriving (even having paid in full for a business class ticket) unless their connection is the same day. This in spite of advertising that suggests otherwise. Icelandair's own """"access rules"""" website simply says traveling on Saga or Economy plus which is not the case. Icelandair will deny you arrival access. The chance for a cup of coffee internet access and a shower is not available for those not transferring same day.""",3,-0.232618709
H Pugh,The lounge is accessed via a lift from the man concourse. My flight time was :pm so I arrived after lunch. The staff were very friendly a good choice of drinks and excellent selection of cold food was available rather like a smorgasbord together with sandwiches and cakes plus chocolates. The lounge had TV's and daily worldwide newspapers. The seating was comfortable and the decor good and airy. Bathroom facilities ok. Free wifi accessed by a password provided on each table.,4,0.550519389
C Blue,Fresh lounge with good basic facilities. The light breakfast offered on my visit was more than adequate. All staff were polite and helpful. The shower a big plus in itself when traveling overnight and bathroom facilities clean and pleasant.,4,0.550519389
Mark Ackery,This lounge is one of the best I have been in. You get a locker and key to leave your luggage in if you want to sit quietly and read. Food was excellent and a great variety to choose from. Drinks were also good and lots of choice. Staff were really friendly and helpful. This lounge has lots of Icelandair pictures hung on the walls and it feels warm and inviting. Such a difference from the lounge they use in Boston.,5,1.333657488
F Wong,The lounge was fairly easy to find once past passport control. Staff very welcoming lounge is tastefully designed and overlooking the tarmac which means ample lighting and feeling of openness. Free wifi available and fast and steady. Plenty of seating. The lounge is split into two levels upper level for dining lower level for tea coffee and snacks. Very clean bathroom and shower facilities plentiful. I was disappointed with the lack of food selections some sandwiches rice beef curry and spicy bean curd dish available. Okay selection of drinks and alcohol. I was disappointed by the lack of sweets and desserts only cookies nuts and bite-size cheese available. It is obvious to see Japan Airlines is trying to cut cost.,4,0.550519389
D West,Very early departure on BA back to Heathrow. Got there about ! Watched sunrise and had some lovely strawberries. Departure delayed  mins so as we were travelling First we went next door to First lounge which opened at . Nice peaceful surroundings and a short hop to the departure gate. Very pleasant all round.,4,0.550519389
K Fong,One of the best lounges I have been in. I managed to get a hr nap in a private cubicle with a bed followed by food and drinks in the restaurant area. This was followed by a massage and nice hot shower.,5,1.333657488
P Colegate,Lounge accessed as a Qantas Club member for flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Lounge located Pre- Security screening in Terminal D Space Frankfurt International. The Sakura Lounge is modestly large. Professionally welcomed by front desk staff. Lounge neat tidy well lit. Many seating options. for passengers travelling in groups of two four and individual travellers. Showers accessible small but functional. Towels provided. Toilets clean well maintained. A bar/ Soft drinks counter area is well stocked and with plenty of options. A small sign points to the 'Buffet' area. A small counter with two bowls one of cubed fetta cheese and olives. A small buffet hatch contained multiple small sandwiches of meats and cheeses. Modest. Cups glasses plates & attire quickly cleaned by a group of kitchen attendants. Flight information discreetly but well displayed in multiple areas of lounge. Announcements discreet and audible. Plenty of news papers in Japanese German and English. Light & airy well laid out professional staff. Furnishings looking slightly worn.,4,0.550519389
F Hasek,Great little lounge extremely polite helpful staff good drink selection. Spa and shower are good and functional.,5,1.333657488
Robert Hoey,This is the worst business class lounge I have ever been in. The drink selection is poor and only a few cookies for food. It is extremely small and the no smoking area wreaked of smoke. It is more comfortable sitting at the gate. At least by the gate you aren't subjected to second hand smoke.,2,-1.015756808
R Pearce,Flew Qantas San Francisco to Sydney. Apparently Qantas uses the JAL lounge rather than the BA for some reason. The Lounge was absolutely packed very small rooms little to eat or drink apart from chips. It was so depressing that I had to leave. Minimal staff not helpful. Very disappointing when a hr+ flight is ahead of you!,3,-0.232618709
Y Ren,Two first class lounge at Terminal  easy to find dinning area but no restaurant service. Quality of food okay but not outstanding mainly Japanese food. good range of drinks. Staff tried to speak English but really difficult to understand. Wifi service and wired computer available. Spa services only have massage for  minutes.,4,0.550519389
Bill Atkins,Very small but a haven of peace as they restrict it only To First Class passengers much to the annoyance of OneWorld Emerald members. Food offering poor and no champagne but polite service and free internet.,4,0.550519389
Bill Atkins,Although crowded at peak times this is a wonderful lounge. Very friendly and polite staff always looking to help. Great choice of Japanese and Western food and drinks. Only criticism would be small number of restrooms for such a big facility.,5,1.333657488
John Estrada,Beautiful lounge with spa like shower rooms available. Complimentary massage was just the topping on the cake. Plentiful buffet and open bar (believe there's a bartender in the afternoon). All staff was absolutely gracious and accomodating. It seemed to be extremely crowded in the morning as we were unable to find two lounge chairs together.,4,0.550519389
Brian Smith,This lounge is for business class premium economy class and their premier class passengers. The first class passengers have a separate one I believe. This lounge was large covering two floors. On the upper floor there is a buffet. Yes an honest to god buffet of food not just packaged snacks. Great offerings of both hot and cold dishes and plenty of seating. As always children annoy me. Why and how do they get into places like this? Their running around and screaming a real turn off.,4,0.550519389
Clive Thomas,Good view of apron - convenient for gates for intercontinental flights. Nice breakfast includig Japanese choices and eggs/sausage etc changing to lunch at  - plenty of choice fabulous beef curry! Free massages etc. Didn't feel crowded. Remarkable beer machine with automatic tilting to get perfect head.,4,0.550519389
K Losse,The lounge is somewhat small and rather crowded with business travelers. However they have a nice supply of traditional Japanese snacks (rice wrapped in seaweed for example) and a good spread of tea sodas beer and cocktails. Definitely nicer than many domestic American lounges though not luxurious.,4,0.550519389
T Kinder,Light and airy with views over the apron - a good lounge. Complimentary massage service. Range of food in service a little narrow but tasty. Self service bar coffees soft drinks etc. Enough computer and printing terminals. Separate smoking room so main lounge remains smoke free. Not as good as Malaysia's KL Business lounge.,4,0.550519389
T Kinder,Small lounge overlooking apron with just enough seating for a / full business cabin. Beverage and snack range quite small - a choice of red or white wine beer juices soft drinks and tea/coffee. For morning flight sandwiches pastries and some sushi were available. Washrooms very small with few amenities - not even a toothbrush or razor. LAN network available for laptops etc. A reasonable quiet spot away from the hubub of Sydney's international terminal shops. Disappointed that was not advised to stay in lounge but to board plane when departure was delayed  minutes due to plane's mechanical problems.,2,-1.015756808
F Trevel,Was very pleasantly surprised by the new Sakura Business Lounge in Terminal  at Narita Airport. Such an improvement over the previous one. All the necessary amenities were available including a good selection of drinks and snacks reading material and then hot foods and salad offered on an upper level. The lounge is attractively decorated open and spacious with lots of windows. The seating was comfortable and washrooms well maintained. It is one of the better business lounges I have been in over the past few years. Definitely a place you don't mind spending any number of hrs. in before a long flight.,5,1.333657488
Stephen Conroy,The new Sakura Lounge is a significant improvement on the old one. It is now equipped with truly awesome shower studios and complimentary shiatsu massage facilities. Wi-fi access is also complimentary and there is a large business corner with ample supply of desktop PC's. The mezzanine level also offers excellent hot food catering. Bar facilities offer an average choice of drinks. Seating in the lounge is very comfortable and spacious. Overall this lounge is now up to the standards of its competitors.,5,1.333657488
T IVERSEN,Air New Zealand uses JAL international lounge in Osaka. Found the lounge very basic. Very limited choice of drinks and the food was nuts and cookies! Nothing else. Seats arranged in long rows all facing the same way. Not very welcoming or relaxing. Staff essentially not present.,2,-1.015756808
L GONZALVES,This Business lounge is very small. Located on the nd floor after the immigration. In an afternoon is overcrowded and you often have to share your table with fellow passengers. Beverages selection is limited but sufficient for short inter north asia flights : coffee/tea soft drinks juices and a few alcoholic drinks (mostly beer). Food is very limited too : They have only japanese cake that are packed individually plus the nuts and cracker to match up when drinking beer. They are serving wraps from subway. I would love to have some japanese food like sushi or noodles. Lavatories are clean no shower. A separate meeting room is available plus copier machine is also available for use. Free internet access if you have your own laptop. No PC terminal available. Most of the reading materials are in Japanese.,3,-0.232618709
L GONZALVES,This Business lounge is OK. Located on the rd floor after the immigration. In the evening is overcrowded and you often have to share your table with fellow passengers. Most passengers are waiting for their intra-US flights. Beverages selection is limited but sufficient for long haul flight and as a main hub in asia: coffee/tea soft drinks juices and a few alcoholic drinks (mostly beer). Food is very limited too : They have only japanese cake that are packed individually plus the nuts and crakers to match up when drinking beer. I would love to have some japanese food like sushi or noodles. Lavatories are clean no shower. A  minutes shoulder and neck massage for free is available from the afternoon till pm but you need to register. A separate meeting room is available plus copier machine is also available for use. Free internet access if you have your own laptop there is a separate room for people who wants to use their laptops. No PC terminal available. The lounge has its irish pub style corner where you can mingle with other guest.,4,0.550519389
Rajan Bulchand,"Disgusting. This can't even be called a lounge. Next time I was at the airport (July ) I did not even visit it. Also the staff is rude and inefficient. Better not to have this lounge as it is used by all airlines, and it actually is a misrepresentation of the airline, or card company offering access.",1,-1.798894906
T Solanki,"Service was good but the lounge becomes very busy as many flight arrive and transit at the same time. Good food and drink choices. Seats are comfortable. Showers are good, but one has to wait as so many people were in queue.",6,2.116795586
Deepa Siddharthan,This is an excellently maintained lounge. Good food and great ambience thereby providing great customer experience. Keep up the good work!,4,0.550519389
Kim Johansen,The shared airline lounge at the new international terminal in Mumbai was excellent. Elevator down one level after you enter the reception lobby to the business class lounge area. Plenty of comfortable seating in a variety of configurations lounge chairs sofas eating tables with chairs and work stations with outlets. The free WiFi was reliable and fast but the logon process is a little tricky. Separate food bar and lounge areas. The food area had a very comprehensive buffet both Western and Indian food one of the best I have seen second only to Dubai. Lots of snacks and fruit which you could take with you for your flight. The bar had a full wall video screen showing sports and a wide selection of beer wine and cocktails. There were also private work rooms for business calls and shower facilities.,5,1.333657488
Stefaan Meulders,We took a Jet Airways domestic flight from Kolkata Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport (CCU) to Delhi (DEL) in business class. At check in we received an invitation to visit the lounge. Lounge was a complete disappointment. Apart of coffee/tea and soft drinks you had to pay for drinks! Iâ€™m a Star Alliance Gold member and visited lots of lounges everywhere but paying for drinks when you already pay the premium for flying business class is just unbelievable! I never had this experience before. Food options were very limited as well and for western style food the only option was Danish butter cookiesâ€¦ (Indian style food wasnâ€™t much neither). Overall appearance of the lounge was rather filthy and not worth a visit.,1,-1.798894906
Robert Walker,"Early morning use of the Aspire Lounge at Newcastle. Good service from staff, a little slow to check in but nothing to bad. Bacon sandwiches very good, but no Irish whiskey of any cider of any type. Come on Aspire, its not much to ask is it!",6,2.116795586
C Marks,The opening of the new Terminal area includes the new Simba and Pride Lounges (I saw both). The new lounges are world class with great food and beverage options (excellent wines) WIFI varied seating areas including quiet business & TV lounge areas and shower rooms. These lounges are a wonderful refuge before a long flight and service was excellent! This was a huge change from previous years flights from NBO.,5,1.333657488
J Furman,"Intolerable noise levels. Constant ringing of some bell for unclear reason, frequent overheads. Frantic atmosphere. No chance of getting a shower. Food is minimal, though not bad what little there is. WiFi a bit sketchy. Bathroom looked like a warzone, used towels everywhere, hadn't been tidied up in quite a while. Inadequate facilities.",1,-1.798894906
Koji Watanabe,"Longe was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Tasty food and drink was served enough. Staff often clean our table and the restrooms.",6,2.116795586
Joanne Klauer,Just brutal. I had a  hour layover on my flight from YYC-JNB. I desperately needed a shower so went to this lounge which was miles from my gate. KLM staff were rude and refused to acknowledge my existence. I finally figured out the number system for the shower. Got  and they were on something under . The lounge was crowded and noisy. I bailed without my shower and didn't even bother with the aggravation on the return trip and made do with wet wipes in the public bathroom. Not what I expected from a Business Class lounge.,1,-1.798894906
Mark Cousins,"This is the worst ""Business Class"" lounge I have been in by a country mile. In fact calling it a lounge is a joke. It's full to capacity some people going straight back out because there aren't enough seats and only  or  charging points to fight over the dÃ©cor is tired and dated. The toilets are absolutely disgusting I walked in then straight out to find some others in the Airport. No wonder they hide this facility down one of the gates and barely signpost it it really is that embarrassing. Most lounges offer easy access Wifi if you fight your way through all the mobile registration palava you're rewarded with a temperamental and incredibly slow service presumably due to the volume of users. Come on KLM you have to do better than this.",2,-1.015756808
Mark Ellwood,Great lounge lots of seating areas good selection to eat and drink. Wi Fi great with no problems staff very good and clean shower toilet areas.,5,1.333657488
S Crowe,"Had high expectations as my family provided solid praise from their visit a few years ago. Was not disappointed. It's not a ""huge"" place but enough room for all on a Saturday afternoon dealing with a variety of flights. The self-serve drinks were varied and adequate the food skewed a bit to Asian spicy (for China Airlines pax?) and the seating comfortable and varied. A nice view of the apron & planes to boot. The only downside was the staffer on desk duty who was quite perplexed on how to deal with our Diner's Club cards had to ask in the back and in the end (as per my statement) I was charged for  guests instead of  free card admissions. (now under dispute for a refund). Ironically we were flying KLM and ran into a rather rude KLM staffer who was flogging $ passes to all & sundry in the check-in area. Said our DC cards would not get us in. (yes they do that lounge desk girl not withstanding). That being said the guest rate for Diner's is only usd$ or about cad$. For about the same you can get into the Plaza Premium lounge right across the hall from Crown. However I do recommend it just try to maximize your time there.",5,1.333657488
K Ramon,We needed to wait for close to four hours as the shopping centre next to the airport turned out to be closed. At Athens international airport KLM uses the Goldair lounge. The lounge offers comfortable chairs and provides good views of the runway but also the car rental centre. Wifi is provided for free but didn't work that well. There are desktop computers available as well as power sockets to charge your devices. What was disappointing was the lack of a shower / changing room (although the toilets were spacious) and the assortment of food was questionable. All in all not a bad experience but nothing like the KLM / Air France operated lounges. We saw that Lufthansa does operate their own lounge at Athens by the way.,3,-0.232618709
J Polley,The KLM/AF lounge is located adjacent to the international boarding gates in terminal D. It can be accessed from the other terminals as well via the inter-terminal train without having to go through security. The lounge is relative small but I have not seen it overcrowded in the two times I visited. The seating is comfortable with the same types of chairs as the KLM lounges in AMS. In the middle of the lounge is the food and beverage area. The food is better than the AMS lounges with sandwiches salads soup cookies and other snacks as well as soft drinks and liquor. The booze selection is better than you will find in domestic carrier lounges. It is all free and self serve. You make everything the way you like it and no bartender to tip. There are two TVs located t either end of the lounge. The staff will accommodate your channel requests. There are boarding announcements and the gates are  seconds or less away. So you can remain in the sanctuary of the lounge until just before stepping on the plane. It would be nice if they added a shower. The restrooms are clean and adequate in number.,4,0.550519389
N Singh,Would recommend this lounge came with all the fixings loads of snacks (great variety too) and drinks. Lounge access was only $ and well worth it great option instead of paying for airport dinner.,5,1.333657488
H Dalem,Nice surroundings comfortable chairs good connections good food and drinks (but limited choice). Can be crowded at times because so many partner airlines may use it as well. Well kept toilet area and shower facilities. A good start towards a long flight.,4,0.550519389
G Garrison,If you're flying out of Dammam this is the only lounge in town and it's marginally better than hanging out in the gate area at a coffee shop or the soon to be completed Cinnabon. Service in the lounge is almost non-existent and food selection is hit or miss -- sometimes there was dismal food but no plates to put it on other times there were marginally edible hot dishes (for example: rice a kind of chicken stew some really boring sauteed vegetables). There were not-very-tempting pastries in plastic wrap,,
H Mirza,We had a long layover at Muscat so decided to crash at Oman Air Business Lounge. Great clean full facilities and food. Have great separate area for sleeping. Biggest problem was noises made by loud staff throwing dishes and they started vacuuming at am.,4,0.550519389
M Kroes,Lounge is open since may  located on the first floor. The lounge is small and has a variety of drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic and breads/croissants. There is wifi (the cloud) and a tv with danish channels. For this small airport the lounge is in my opinion sufficient.,3,-0.232618709
S Bingham,A fairly large lounge plenty of space and wifi. Food choice poor and quality not up to much. Was very disappointing. Being a smoker the only saving grace was the smoking room in the lounge.,3,-0.232618709
S Bingham,Why bother the lounge is so small only sandwiches a few random spirits no toilet/shower in the lounge. Go to the Air France lounge a few meters away.,2,-1.015756808
H Sheth,One of the worst lounges they fill it up until there is no space left food is too basic no shower facilities as part of the entry you have to pay extra. And the service is quite bad.,1,-1.798894906
Mark Nicholls,The worst lounge? Like Air France Business Class Lounge in Paris CDG KLM clearly take the view that business class passengers are just a nuisance. The lounge is just row upon row of tired seating. The food is awful and wine undrinkable. Sad to say having just achieved gold status on Flying Blue (by accident!) I will probably have to use it again but I will want to eat elsewhere. And the staff have zero interest in passengers. Finally the washroom was filthy and smelt really bad. The one redeeming feature the WiFi copes will despite the constant overcrowding.,1,-1.798894906
C Wajsberg,Not my first time in this lounge and it has nicely improved for those who remember the previous lounge. Food quality receives an average score. Drinks as much as you want. Cleaning and cooking staff should work faster as many plates of food remained empty too long and many empty plates and glasses remained too long where nobody was sitting. Staff are polite and helpful. Showers and lavatories are clean and comfortable showers can be very busy at peak hours. Seats are comfortable and give you a nice view of airport. If there would be some more tvs and some reading material such as international news papers this lounge would receive a better note.,4,0.550519389
S Ramet,Tiny lounge for KLM and Air France. In the evening when both flights to Amsterdam and Paris leave within mins of each other people were standing around. Very warm poor selection of food. One drinks machine and slow internet. I left soon after and went to main terminal to get more space and air.,3,-0.232618709
Lars Jakobsen,The lounge is nice with ample room. The choices of bevarages and food/snacks are OK. Cleanliness is somewhat debatable as the gents toilets were dirty and with an unpleasant smell. But the policy of internet access was really annoying - you get  mins free acess - and that's it. When I asked for another acess card I was rather impolitely told that there were only one per customer! Arguably you could use your mobile with tethering but that's also expensive. A better plan for wifi access would be a nice touch.,3,-0.232618709
A Kor,I have used this lounge for KLM flights to and fro from Kuala Lumpur to Chicago. The lounge is big and spreads out. You can find a comfortable spot. There is a quiet room for those who prefer a nap. The food is not that great so best to have meals outside the lounge.,4,0.550519389
Peter Ladegaard,Best thing to say about KLM lounges in Scriphol is that they are big. Most other services are mediocre. Biggest of all concerns is the attitude with most of the staff servicing customers : they are constantly sipping coffee and tea which they serve themselves from the same place as customers. When it comes to service they are usually short rude and inconsistent (between staff and the two lounges in the airport). I have been coming in the KLM lounges for well over five years and this is a repeated observation.,3,-0.232618709
Keith Williams,Visited the KLM Crown Lounge en route between Manchester and Taipei. First visit was pm in the evening and the lounge was quiet with plenty of choice of seats excellent choice of food and drink and fast wifi. On the way back we arrived at am and the lounge was far busier but the choice of food for breakfast items was still very comprehensive although the Wifi seemed a bit slower. I took advantage of the complimentary shower facilities but had to wait over an hour for my slot as it was so busy but as we had a long lay over it was no issue for me.,5,1.333657488
R Sani,Morning visit before my connection to FRA. Very large clean and new looking lounge full breakfast bar hot and cold food and drinks. WIFI was available but didn't have time to use it.,4,0.550519389
R Sani,This terminal was under construction while I was there. Its located up stairs and you have to go out of the secure area. Roomy lounge and not crowded with nice view comfortable seating cold/warm food and lots of drinks of all kinds.  min before the boarding time a KLM rep came to escort all passengers to the security point and made it to the gate few min just before boarding and all went very well.,3,-0.232618709
Brian E Smith,I arrived for a mid-morning flight and huge lounge was packed out. The food and drink area was in a circular design to handle the hordes but food was not of particularly good quality and the lounge didn't have a feeling of exclusivity. Much more food on offer out in the terminal itself. Only good point was free wifi and a free drink.,3,-0.232618709
Brian E Smith,Not impressed with this lounge. At breakfast it was packed to the brim with passengers and the food on offer was very limited. Old computers tired furniture and a hectic atmosphere made me think it would be better to just go outside to one of the many concessions. No elite feeling whatsoever.,3,-0.232618709
M Mclean,This was my first experience with my Priority Pass and I have to say I was very disappointed. Although this is a very small Airport the lounge was no more than a few couches and a magazine or two no Internet Access was available and the snacks were crackers or cookies in a package along with soda and water. This was all you received for $ per person! I let Priority Pass know as soon as I arrived home and their response was sorry. In reading some other reviews it seems there are no standard levels of service with the lounges although they all charge the same price for access. I am sure there are some very nice lounges to offset the ones like I experienced perhaps a rating system would help prevent someone from experiencing what I did.,2,-1.015756808
C Stone,KLM Crown Lounge is very large. You might find yourself walking quite a distance to reach depending on which gate you are departing from. The front desk staff are friendly and the wifi log in details are displayed at the desk. The seats are comfortable and have plug outlets. The food is actually pretty good. During lunch/dinner time you can get fried rice with chicken curry. For breakfast they serve a lot of pastries and other stuff. They have a large restroom inside the lounge as well as a business center where you can use the complimentary computers.,5,1.333657488
M Fitzpatrick,This is the lounge KLM inflicts upon it's business class passengers (not operated by KLM). It's small with dated decor. There is only one toilet cubicle for each sex. Food looked very ordinary. No wine. So bad I left and went to the bar opposite - so I could at least still use the free wifi. Please KLM - do a deal with Malaysian Airlines for your passengers to use their lounge. They're your codeshare partner in this part of the world!,3,-0.232618709
P Kniebusch,KLM/Air France Business Class Lounge in Johannesburg was dirty uncomfortable and shabby. I had the impression that it is the old Virgin Atlantic Lounge KLM/Air France took over the old lounge and that was it. They might think it is not necessary to renovate the place but at the moment it is not the standard of KLM/Air France. During my stay my table was never cleared of glasses or plates. There was nobody to clean the place or to take care of anything.,2,-1.015756808
G Enders,One of the worst lounges I have ever been to. Even the ones at Heathrow that you can pay for which the airlines do not provide are much better than this one.,2,-1.015756808
E Cuignet,KLM crown lounge in AMS is far below its sister lounge in CDG. Little food to eat it was lunch time and poor quality of drinks. My seven year old son was charged e to be able to get inside the lounge whereas he got in for free at Paris. So I paid e so that he could drink a glass of water and have some crackers. KLM staff is rough in the air and on the ground.,2,-1.015756808
Dirk Visser,Lounge huge with a nice assortment of snacks and drinks and there was a nice beef bourgignon on offer. Plenty of newspapers free WiFi but not the best speed. Staff friendly.,4,0.550519389
B Coicadin,Crown lounge near gates B. Very clean and adequate shower cubicles. Had a few drinks and nibbles from the bar broad choice of newspapers. Very good lounge stylish with plenty of corners and areas to suit mood or privacy.,4,0.550519389
B Lafond,Probably one of the dirtiest lounge I have ever visited: stained carpet greasy windows. The choice of food is very limited and of industrial quality. Choice of alcohol is minimal. On the upside nice view on the runway and fast wifi.,2,-1.015756808
Mark Williams,To say we were disappointed and underwhelmed with this lounge is an understatment. Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left  hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did. Will be transiting through Incheon in a couple of weeks on way home but don't think we'll bother going to this lounge at all.,2,-1.015756808
N Sundera,Large lounge with a variety of seating options and a nice view of the tarmac. I visited on two occasions late at night and early in the morning. Food options at that time were limited with only a few eastern and western choices which were hard to assemble into a coherent dinner or breakfast. Wine and spirits were available at both times. Only prepacked cups of water were available - bottles of water would be better. The shower facilities were clean and spacious but there was a  minute wait for a shower early in the morning despite the lounge not being full. Overall a satisfactory space though not exceptional.,3,-0.232618709
I McClung,"A large open plan lounge which feels light and airy but very functional. Seats are comfortable with light and power at the vast majority. The selection of food was limited to nibbles/snacks - snack biscuits cheese cubes cheery tomatoes and soup. Not a great deal else - no sandwiches. Wine selection was good Heineken beer on tap and a range of standard quality spirits were on offer. Wifi was free however required you to reconfigure your mailbox if you wished to send emails. An enclosed entertainment area playing news channels made up the centre piece of the lounge washrooms were clean and tidy. The downside of the lounge was that there seemed to be a lack of staff clearing away such a large area resulting in a number of tables having ""leftovers"" on them for a considerable periods of time.",3,-0.232618709
J Landman,The lounge is not that bad once you get past the very inconsistent service agents. This time I was refused lounge access as although being a Platinum for life I had a boarding pass for Turkish Airlines!,3,-0.232618709
Jonathan Grimes,Used both Schengen and  lounge - great improvement over last time I used them - they have been refurbished. Free WiFi was very welcome. Good selection of self service drinks - snacks very limited. A good place to spend an hour of so waiting for your next flight.,4,0.550519389
Yana Morris,Used this lounge as Aeroflot passenger. It was dirty and crowded. There was no food accept for few crackers and some cheese. Plenty of soft drinks that were restocked fast. The communication between the plane and the lounge was terrible. We were asked to proceed to boarding and the plane was nowhere near ready! The receptionist was very clueless. We ended up waiting in line in front of the gate for  min Overall a pretty depressing experience.,2,-1.015756808
Bill Salomon,"After a six hour flight from Singapore to Incheon in Prestige Class we attempted to use the Prestige Lounge to freshen up before our  hour layover. We were denied access stating that it was against policy. I spoke with a very polite supervisor who could not understand why we would want to use their lounge if we were not continuing on with them. When I explained that KE does not fly to San Antonio they could not care less. Thankfully AA has a contract with Asiana where the first class lounge was clean comfortable and well equipped. Next time I want to spend US$ between ICN and SIN you can be sure I will remember and inform KE that it is not in ""my policy"" to waste money on a carrier who only cares about you until you cross the airplane threshold.",1,-1.798894906
O Banderas,Crowded lounge with good drinks selection and meagre snacks. Overall plastic and cheap-feel to it compared to AF or EK lounges in Dubai. Still a welcome haven from the crowded Dubai airport main lounges.,4,0.550519389
Lynne Fyfe,This lounge is shared by several airlines and was a pretty poor show. The lounge was really congested and there were not enough seats for all the passengers. Our flight was delayed so we spent even longer in there than planned. The front desk staff were pleasant but they chatted to one another non stop about another member of staff. As I was seated beside them I could not help but overhear. Not very professional!,2,-1.015756808
Drew McManus,A very underwhelming business class lounge. food selection and quality is mediocre it is always busy and the toilets and shower rooms are boiling hot. What use is it to take a shower only to sweat through a shirt before you leave the shower room? At first I thought it was just me because I overheat easily but watching other passengers leave the shower area they were all red faced and sweating. Then there's the obvious issues with cleanliness the showers I've used have all had mould there is no shower curtain so the water splashes out onto your luggage and all over the floor. Add to that no wash cloths one towel and no floor mat and it is an entirely unpleasant experience. I've given them a few opportunities but from here on out I'm just going to go without a shower,,
Ralph Janser,I cannot follow to my former writers who recommended this Lounge. No choice of food no bottles of water or coke just glasses. Crowded! Impossible from KE to allocate this Lounge for full paying Business-Guests.,3,-0.232618709
J Polley,There are two KE business class lounges at ICN. The larger and more plush lounge is located in the passenger terminal immediately past security. Both lounge areas have the same food and drinks but the one on the right is usually less crowded. The food is simple but more substantial than in most US airline lounges wine and liquor selections adequate. The shower facilities are located adjacent to this section of the lounge - clean and everything you need to refresh. The other lounge is on the concourse that serves foreign carriers like Delta and Skyteam flights. This lounge is smaller and is generally more stark and less comfortable. The food and drinks are the same. There are several smaller rooms at the back of the lounge that have TVs and comfortable seating. They are usually empty or have only one or two other passengers. English channels are available for catching up on current events. Neither lounge can issue boarding passes or change seats.,4,0.550519389
Michael Hollifield,I had a guest pass before by ICN-BKK flight and arrived with around  hours to spend in the lounge. Most travelers go to the left from the desk and that side of the lounge is full of people. If you pass the showers on the right there is an area with the same food and beverage offerings but less people. I was there all day the food stayed the same - standard hotel buffet. Nothing super special but filling. The bar was self serve beer wine whisky scotch and Jack Daniels. My only complaint was the smoking room. I know most airports do not have this but in Korea they are extremely necessary. Many Koreans smoke and the tiny closet sized room was continually full to the point of no room to move. The bathrooms were a little dirty upon arrival but were cleaned after I left it.,5,1.333657488
Ted Wilson,I was somewhat disappointed in the facilities of the business class lounge at Hong Kong airport. Was waiting to board A to Seoul but it was very bland lots of seats and a desk for internet. Food selection not interesting and attendant less than friendly. They really need to upgrade this lounge. Doesn't encourage one to think of Korean Air as a possibility for long haul flights.,3,-0.232618709
John Holdsworth,KAL Business (Prestige) lounge at Incheon Airport is far too small for the numbers of passengers using it. I passed through this lounge twice in a period of four weeks and it was very crowded both times. It is showing it age and is desperately in need of a face lift and a substantial increase in size. The food on offer was poor a couple of hot Korean dishes cheese nuts cakes and biscuits. Drinks were ok but not exciting. The shower rooms were good and kept very clean. The desk staff were not particularly friendly and would not even look at a request for a seat change on my next flight. No boarding calls made but I quite like that is it helps keep the noise level down monitor screens around the lounge enable passengers to see what is happening with their flight.,3,-0.232618709
John Holdsworth,This has to be the poorest Business Class (Prestige Class) lounge I have ever been in. It is too small and has no ambience at all. The food and drink selection was virtually non existant a few cakes and biscuits plus tea and coffee and a few cold drinks were all that was on offer and this was around noon waiting to board the A to Incheon. I didn't use the showers so I cannot comment on the quality or condition. The desk staff were ok and the cleaning staff did a good job of clearing up.,3,-0.232618709
R Fitzgerald,This is really a very disappointing and bad experience. Basically the lounge has nothing to offer and can not be regarded as an intercontinental business class lounge. There is only one lounge worse than the intercontinental KAL lounge in Incheon,,
H Kim,Sofas are very comfortable. Complimentary wifi food delicious but would be better if there were more choices. Same applies to beverages too. Newspapers available but only the ones printed in Korea Japan or China. No British American French or German newspapers available. Great view of tarmac from the lounge. Lounge is secluded from the public area so is very quiet. Very clean and nice toilets.,5,1.333657488
R Ganbich,Actually a very poor experience. The lounge itself was fair comfortable seating an ample drinks selection. If one wanted a hot drink one was confronted with a dispenser only labelled in Japanese/Korean staff quite unwilling to help. As there was no catering (only rice crackers and savoury crackers) for this just-after-lunchtime departure. This added to an unsatisfactory experience mostly on the account of the rude and unhelpful staff. I do not consider it a problem to have a limited command of English in a non-english speaking country and working in a mostly non-english speaking place but it is very problematic to combine this with such a rude attitude.,2,-1.015756808
R Ganbich,A very pleasant experience and a good start for an overnight trip to Seoul. Lounge is on the way from check-in to gate. Very relaxed and spacious no outside windows. Drinks are made to order. Choice is a bit limited perhaps but the lounge staff are kind and enthusiastic. No meal service only peanuts crisps and the like. Each passenger was personally informed about when it was time to board.,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Binder,It's ok but not grand. Food selection limited. Beverages are good. Bathrooms are outside of lounge. Internet has always been very difficult when I come here. This time I was told to use Northwest connection which they said is better (and no password setup). They were right.,3,-0.232618709
Renny Snell,Large lounge situated upstairs clearly signposted. Comfortable seating. Excellent food and drink - a wide range food changing according to hour. Obliging staff. Shower room I used was fine - large well-stocked. No internet terminals but several hook-up points and I the entire lounge wifi for those equipped with laptops. Magazine and newspaper provision a rather limited. No flights calls but several departure screens available.,4,0.550519389
Chris Matthews,Very large business class concept lounge. Many seats in Asian fashion. Very dark minimal lighting overlooking runway. Small central food area with packaged cakes and cookies available various assortments of pot of noodles (the type where you add your own hot water). Small bar area with light beverages available coffee and tea - only three available alcoholic beverages ,,
Chris Matthews,Very clinical looking lounge. However lots of space clean staff friendly. Used by a few airlines in the SkyTeam network. Lots of food available - from sandwiches to sushi to Chocolate Cake. Open bar and coffee machines. Not sure of internet area.,4,0.550519389
Chris Matthews,Nice big lounge at Incheon airport solely for the use of Prestige Class Passengers. Took a while to find it though as no clear direction. Comfortable seating  a little bit clinical rather than homely feel. Staff Friendly only breakfast cereals and breads on offer at the time I was there  however still had a full bar service. Did not see any computers for internet browsing. Had a small smoking room which was comfortable with Plasma TV and away from the non smoking section.,3,-0.232618709
MARK RANDALL,Nice lounge on the Upper floor. Spacious when I used it. Seating comfortable in groups of  chairs but a bit boring in layout - nice views out across runway etc. Staff very polite and obliging and will bring you drink or food to your table. Selection of foods a bit limited and would expect more in a nice F class lounge - drinks etc okay though. Shower rooms and relaxing area but found to be rather basic and short on normal F class lounge amenities. No boarding calls and staff do not check which passenger on what flight so had a real rush to boarding gate in the end.,4,0.550519389
MARK RANDALL,Very small lounge with no daylight no washrooms etc and full at time of use. Korean need to get something much better and bigger as this was horrid - the main T is better and more comfortable and that is Heathrow we are talking about. No proper selection of foods apart from nuts and crackers no internet or wireless and seating is cramped as they try to squash as many people in as possible. Nice staff who are polite and welcoming but otherwise this is a really poor standard of lounge.,2,-1.015756808
C Jordan,Run of the mill lounge good selection of newspapers basic food and drink. Wifi. Clean toilets.,4,0.550519389
C Jordan,One of the best lounges I have come across. Spacious comfortable seating well stocked with day's newspapers and well stocked bar and food. Spotless toilets.,5,1.333657488
Keith Williams,A pretty poor Lounge. While the chairs were reasonably comfortable and the Lounge was clean the food quality and choice was very poor. Crisps and nuts were OK but the sandwiches were dried up with a very poor selection. I never discovered what was on the savoury biscuits. There were unlabelled jugs of coloured fluid - presumably drinks - and Coke/Fanta etc available from the bar. Alcoholic drinks were available at a charge. The computer I went to use wouldn't connect to the internet but someone from the front desk sorted it quickly.,3,-0.232618709
A Jones,Awful. Why bother. The Lufthansa lounge  m is excellent. Why does LOT bother using this tired old lounge from Korean air where the choice of beverages is poor and the food frankly dreadful.,1,-1.798894906
U Fischer,The new LOT/ Star Alliance lounge is an excellent addition. Signage to the lounge can be a little confusing as one can end up in the â€œoldâ€ lounge on the main level. However after locating the lounge upstairs one is greeted in a very modern and open (no ceiling) environment with GOOD natural light. The lounge is not very large but IS comfortable. Free Wi-Fi is available not always available at many airport lounges.,4,0.550519389
Marc Pauquet,After passport & security control was difficult to find the right lounge - found the Polonez lounge after a while running around the airport. Nice small lounge in warm colours poor food and beverage assortment only some cold cuts and - kind of cheeses some olives vegetables nuts and chocolates.,3,-0.232618709
V Rab,In WAW there are  lounges all with pretty much the same amenities. In the non-schengen area there is Bolero downstairs. Schengen T has Ballada which is pretty small it is much better to make the trek to T to use Preludium which is larger and far less busy and has a large screen TV. All lounges have a few internet terminals and wi-fi. Lounges have basic snacks as well as candy sandwiches and hot pasta in a cup bar with spirits wine and beer as well as soft drinks/water. There are plenty of international and Polish newspapers and magazines available. There are no showers.,3,-0.232618709
D Balinowski,Lounge is operated by the airport. It's pretty basic. The lounges in Terminal  were nicer. Good selection of food and drink. Seating okay. Reading materials provided. Nothing special.,3,-0.232618709
Michael Bucka,"A warm welcome from Lufthansa Lounge Staff. Lounge is split into two sections, one larger for business and one smaller for first. It is one of my preferred lounges as it has a direct connect thru a door to the jet bridge of the plane. Food and wine is excellent for a lounge, where the seating area for first can improve. As first class passenger, you can order wine and food from a menu and get it served on your table. For business class there is a food and bar with different kind of warm and cold food available. I got my food served right on the boarding call and the ground staff gave me another  min to finish as we were good on time.  Overall great service.",6,2.116795586
Adalbert Wolfgang,"A dignified and relaxing lounge, very attentive Lufthansa staff. Excellent DO&CO cuisine with buffet and a la carte dishes, dreamlike desserts.",6,2.116795586
W Robert Kmen,"This lounge is quite large, and at am the seating was adequate and varied with leather chairs, work stations, and eating counters. The food and beverage selections were ample and tasty. The most important aspect however was the Lufthansa staff. There was a major problem with my reservation and ticket that didn't become apparent until after check-in, security, and passport control. When I went on-line to see if the adjacent seat was still open, I discovered that my assigned seat showed as unoccupied. The Lufthansa staff in the lounge spent  minutes calling back and forth to various United Airlines agents to resolve the problem. I will be eternally grateful to this staff and to Lufthansa in general. If I we're mean and petty, I would complain that this lounge is located in an interior space and offers no view of tarmac or runway. Nevertheless, if the situation boils down to viewing airplanes or getting to board a plane on which you thought you had a confirmed seat, I will go with the latter. Kudos and a thousand thanks to Lufthansa.",6,2.116795586
M Vermeire,I cannot understand why Lufthansa use this lounge - shared by a lot of companies it is a very umpleasant place. Not very clean with an extremely poor choice of drinks and food. The soft drinks in the fridge were not chilled. Staff unfriendly and slow service.,2,-1.015756808
Robert Kmen,"Visited on st June  before UA  to LHR. Even though this lounge was overcrowded ( at : )and required a considerable odyssey from the UA gates, it was still worth the trek. They have champagne, free cocktails, and a more-than-adequate supply of good things to eat. There are big windows that overlook the tarmac, and you certainly get a good view of an Austrian Airlines . In sum, German efficiency, fine hospitality, and easily the best lounge at IAD If you're Star Gold, take the hike.",6,2.116795586
N Shilepsky,Very disappointing. No real food during mid-day. No free wi-fi beyond what the airport provides (one half hour). Not what we would have expected.,2,-1.015756808
Nick Wilcock,Another visit to this lounge and nothing has been done to improve the miserably inadequate levels of catering. Soup or spaetzle potato salad and that's about it apart from a few pieces of bread and some peppers plus sweets and peanuts. So I've made yet another complaint and will keep doing so until something is done to improve matters.,2,-1.015756808
Nick Wilcock,The standard of catering in this lounge continues to deteriorate. Today the only choices were broth or soup - and a couple of trays of stewed vegetables. Plus the usual potato salad bread etc - but no meat of any kind. This lounge was once quite good but is now very mediocre. Also WiFi is often stretched to the limit. The two receptionists seemed totally bored and lacked much in the way of customer service skills. Come on Lufthansa - give this place a much-needed make over!,3,-0.232618709
J Kelleher,Fantastic lounge with spacious shower rooms and ample seating. The buffet has a wide variety of food and beverages along with excellent staff.,5,1.333657488
J Comissiong,Lounge was comfortable but a few more quiet areas would have been nicer: i.e. more space. Good choice of snacks refreshments & warm food. No queues & adequate to drink. Was not aware of any massage services.,4,0.550519389
J Comissiong,The lounge is hopelessly overcrowded the wifi doesn't function the food quality & display leave a lot to be desired. The cleanliness of the food preparation counters are unappetizing. Lufthansa & the Star Alliance are doing themselves a dis-service in offering its business class passengers this lounge.,2,-1.015756808
I Rye,Obviously new. Very comfortable with showers available.  beers on tap pour your own. Nice selection of wines. We were there at lunch time and had hot dogs and  different soups plus salad bar. Wifi instant connect with no password. Certainly better lounge than a lot.,5,1.333657488
Olle Olerup,The most complicated WiFi-access ever. The Lufthansa/Star Alliance lounge at the Delhi International Airport is fine except for the strange WiFi-routines. The lounge is big nice furniture good access to electricity nice staff clean good food and beverage selection clean restrooms but the WiFi! You receive an access code per device. You have to enter these codes and then wait for an SMS with some kind of verification code. When you return to the webpage after receiving the SMS-sent code then you are back to the initial page again and have to start all over again. If you are lucky you are logged in. If you are inactive on the internet for a few minutes you are logged out and have to ask for a new code and start all over again. Why make it so complicated. It is like the domestic Lufthansa lounges in the early s.,3,-0.232618709
R Deu,The new lounge which was opened at the same time as new Z Concourse is very modern. However I noticed that the food selection and quality is getting lower each month. The sweets are just regular cookies but in the past there were chocolate pastries! The LH staff at the counter inside is far more occupied by phone or chit-chatting with each other than taking care of the passengers. I also noticed they grab drinks and snacks from the main bar and would enjoy them at their work position. No more refreshing towels on display to take. Now you have to ask for them at the counter and you get no more than !,3,-0.232618709
I Thernot,"Pleasant and spacious lounge with an acceptably tasty selection of warm/cold food snacks and beverages. Entrance staffing is odd. Non-LH entrance check leaves the two LH lounge dragons free to communicate nonstop. Which they do. Not by way of greeting guests more like ""nonstop them"". Weird choices of hot food: Both dishes were made of pork on both visits highly Muslim-friendly. The longest mobile-phone conversation clearly audible was when a Sky Chefs employee answered her phone to discuss her Sunday lunch. At least it sounded more interesting than what Sky Chefs offered in the lounge. Empty trays used to be refilled at faster speeds so your selection may be drastically reduced during a short visit. Empty dishes are removed from tables at infrequent intervals. Sky Chefs and LH offer a consistent experience: They present themselves as self-serving organisations which will accommodate customers albeit grudgingly and only once done with themselves.",3,-0.232618709
C Barkei,Very decent size with a good range of food and drink available including weissbier on tap which is always welcome and traditional Bavarian specialties,,
S Santens,The lounge was very busy at peak times however the food was good and the bathrooms were clean.,4,0.550519389
D Chamberlain,An excellent lounge - bright comfortable welcoming staff good food and drinks. There was a calm environment friendly and efficient. Food was good in quality and variety and the drinks were plentiful and restocked efficiently. Very good.,4,0.550519389
S Taylor,Fairly simple in all respects but calm and not too busy. Easy to get things done so functionally good. Service is ok but lacks warmth something I have noticed in the lounge on Level G too.,4,0.550519389
Mauricio Canosa,First time in this lounge used AA Admirals Club and TAM First Class lounges previously while traveling on Lufthansa. This lounge is a downgrade. Very small and claustrophobic with no views and no windows. A small buffet of sub-standard appetizers including small salads and sweets which did not look appetizing. A poor bar selection couldn't find anything I wanted to drink. Had to seat and wait but temperature in the room was really high and I decided to leave and wait close to the gate instead. Hope Lufthansa will find a better options for their First and Business class customers as this does not match their high standards.,3,-0.232618709
Mauricio Canosa,Munich First Class lounge is still one of Lufthansa's best. Very well appointed elegant and classy with great service. In the restaurant plenty of good choices both on buffet and a la carte menu. Extensive wines and spirit list. Large magazines and newspapers selection. In the spa I noticed a drop in the level of service they no longer provided bath salts and other toiletries but one generic shower gel to be used as bubble bath shampoo soap and everything else. Even the now famous Lufthansa rubber duck was not available at first and had to be requested. Wifi was not working and receptionist suggested me to use the general Munich Flufghafen wifi which was ok. Later on board their wifi was out too. At the time of boarding had to walk for more than  minutes to the gate while in Frankfurt they automatically offer to take you to plane by a limo. They need to maintain the same standard as in their Frankfurt lounges.,4,0.550519389
S Bingham,A very nice lounge great cocktail bar. Food was also good and a fair choice. Staff friendly. Close to the smoking room. Good size with lots of areas to relax in.,4,0.550519389
K Cacoulidis,Staff is excellent very attentive and friendly. Kids enjoyed the special kids play area. We spent some time in the shower section. Identical with all FCL of LH but here just only one has jacuzzi. Enzo toiletries and have time to relax and refresh. Breakfast choice was ok but quality of some items (croissant pastries) could be better for this level of lounge. Drink choice was really huge and fine. Food that starts at . is outstanding. Several dishes on buffet but the real top is the a la carte restaurant. Finally via private car (a Merc mini van as we were  ) to the aircraft. In total really  star experience.,5,1.333657488
A Panah,The lounge was busy and quite small and it is as with Terminal  ageing. There was still a very poor choice of food and beverages- only a poor quality English breakfast cereals and various hot and cold drinks were available. The lounge was quite comfortable with clean washrooms and good Wifi that worked well but the tables were quite dirty making for an average experience.,3,-0.232618709
Steven Curfs,This is nice new lounge with ok food offerings good selection of beverages and newspapers/magazines. The free WIFI is not fast but works ok for e-mails. The main issue is that it is too small or that too many are allowed into it. In any case it is very difficult to find a place here the toilets are also overcrowded. For some reason they also decided to put just one person in front of the lounge to check your boarding pass so this takes a while especially with people using this employee as an information point. All-in-all good if you manage to find a spot. A definite improvement to the old lounges however.,3,-0.232618709
J Drzecki,Newly opened lounge features impressive seating place with a brilliant view of an apron. There is free wi-fi inside with a very high operating speed. Nice generous choice of food (sandwiches crisps snacks etc.) and one of the best bargains of the alcohol-drinks I've ever seen!,4,0.550519389
T Biastoch,Lufthansa (LH) runs this Lounge as part of the SAS business lounge. The location is not that bad as the backdoor brings you directly to the gate and the staff calls for your flight. It's rather small with about  seats. Free Magazines and Papers WiFi  computers. Beverages are to LH standards food however is below standard. Waiting here for about min no problem  hrs would be a nightmare.,4,0.550519389
S Paice,Spacious lounge just beyond security in terminal A. Leather armchairs plenty of power points and some nice food although the range is a bit limited. Pleasant place to wait for a flight especially as there's not much at all in the airport itself!,5,1.333657488
Steven Curfs,This lounge is very nice with a view on the tarmac reading material good selection of cold dishes desserts and drinks. I have not figured out whether there is free wifi. A good product from Luxair and enjoyable before a flight.,4,0.550519389
Mauricio Canosa,Arrived with Austrian Airlines at T and had a connecting flight to Sao Paulo with Lufthansa. I had to leave the main terminal and after a - minutes outside walk entered the First Class Terminal. Receptionist helped me with passport and security control and showed me the facilities which are exclusive for long haul First class passengers. The terminal has its own duty free and lounge with different seating areas huge bar restaurant and buffet area cigar room bathrooms etc. It is big and very elegant with many leather chairs and sofas and smaller rooms. It has large windows but no apron or runaways views. Huge bathroom complete with plushy towels and bathrobe and ETRO toiletries. Jacuzzi had none of the special spa features of the similar one at their Munich lounge. Small Duty Free had the main brands. Extensive menu for dinner buffet and a-la-carte restaurant but chose to have dinner on the flight instead. Great selection of magazines but wanted to use a computer and was told they no longer offer computers in the lounge which was a disappointment.  minutes before departure escorted downstairs where my passport was checked and Porsche Cayenne to the aircraft. This is a huge terminal which never got crowded very comfortable luxurious and well-appointed. It lacks some of the details of their smaller lounge in Munich.,5,1.333657488
Mauricio Canosa,This lounge doubles as an arrivals and departures lounge so after a flight from Sao Paulo I decided to use the lounge. Nice reception with welcoming staff handed my passport to an official so passport control done in the lounge area which was and nice. Beautiful lounge not a huge one but cozy with different seating areas to choose with leather sofas and cocktail tables (with Mozart chocolates).  or  computer stations. Decided to take a bath more than half-a dozen bathrooms. Large marbled room with a jacuzzi rain shower area with bathrobe towels slippers and ETRO amenities. Staff came back with the Lufthansa First Class Lounge Rubber Duck! In the restaurant area I was handed a menu with brunch choices cooked according to taste but decided to check the buffet instead. Several choices of breads cheeses meats smoked fishes  or  hot entrees sweets etc. Unfortunately the lounge is inside the terminal and offers no apron or runway view but it does provide friendly and efficient service.,5,1.333657488
David Gummers,This is a delightful lounge. The staff knew who we were as I had asked for a massage to be pre- arranged. Check in was efficient. The first visit was on the outward flight to Cape town - so a long bath and rest before dining as we had plenty of time. The service was very friendly. On the return journey we arrived at  and had  hours in the lounge. This time it was more crowded but the service again was impeccable - had a shower and a lovely breakfast. The best bit was the fact the plane was not on a stand so we were taken to the plane by a Merc.,5,1.333657488
Federico Boekenhans,Concourse B luggage pick up area outstanding welcome lounge. Excellent breakfast shower area very clean bathrooms. A very good Lufthansa product.,4,0.550519389

D Kusiak,Travelling with Lufthansa between MIA-FRA. The worst lounge I have ever visited. No service. Food - I would not even call that refreshments awful quality. Drinks only from the bar from a bartender - nothing special. Wi-Fi really slow practically impossible to use. Very crowded. No newspapers. Not worth it. No other options on Concourse J. Very poor facility comparing to regular Lufthansa or other Star Alliance lounges.,2,-1.015756808
R Jones,The lounge in the B concourse area looks very similar to the First Class Terminal but they are worlds apart. This morning there were two men and a woman to greet guests as they arrived. The two men were completely disinterested in greeting or lending a hand to adjust our seats on the next flight. It was like pulling teeth to have them assign us two seats together even though we already knew the flight was nearly half empty. They really don't belong especially after having just stepped off a terrific flight where every staff member did their absolute best to ensure a restful and pleasant journey for each passenger. The lounge is quite full almost every seat is taken. The food offerings look decent but perhaps a tad tired as it's nearly time to switch out for the lunch menu.,4,0.550519389
Reiner Kleppert,They offer only a small snack. I have been in the Lufthansa lounge B on my last flight. That lounge offers much more food and facilities. I was very angry what they offer the passenger at this C lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Howard Atkins,This is a new lounge and much better than the previous shared lounges. Quiet Wifi reasonable food offerings. Very attentive staff.,4,0.550519389
Paul Browne,I am not sure why I still go to this lounge as it has always been overcrowded not particularly clean with poor food offerings. This time the airport public areas outside were more peaceful than this place. Lufthansa really needs to take a look at this lounge and improve the standards as it is an embarrassment.,2,-1.015756808
Dawid Kusiak,This Senator lounge in Munich is one of my favourite. Cosy friendly staff amazing food high quality of wine and champagne and nice atmosphere. This lounge is only for Senator customers and Star Alliance Gold card holders.,5,1.333657488
Thomas Echter,Totally disappointing! Lufthansa advertises its Lounges as something exclusive. But the Lufthansa Business Lounge is such a shame. Food offer is bread rolls jam butter yoghurt a banana and pickled cucumbers. In Berlin at least it was empty but Munich was crowded in a way you don't even find a seat. Having in mind that in order to get into these lounges you were first paying Thousands of euro to Lufthansa flight tickets I am seriously surprised.,3,-0.232618709
J Lynch,Very large lounge it seemed crowded at first but as we walked in a clockwise circle the crowd thinned. A huge variety of snacks and treats to enjoy. A few English newspapers no magazines except Golf. The bathrooms were cramped and awkward to use but clean. The wifi was free. It was a nice place to hang out for  hrs between flights.,4,0.550519389
S Meyer,They know you and where you travel to when you enter the lounge immigration happens there and personally. The lounge is modern but with a warm atmosphere. You can help yourself at the buffet drinks are served to your seat or you can order a hot meal cooked freshly. The selection of food and drinks is great. Huge showers and you can have a bath if you like. Best of all you'll be taken to the plane by limousine if it's parked on an outside position and not docked to a gate.,5,1.333657488
T Harding,What a wonderful enclave of service tucked into DTW's new North terminal. Excellent food/champagne. Attentive staff. Quiet/refined service. Beats any other business lounge in the USA. Limited hours but when open cannot be topped!,5,1.333657488
R White,Lounge is small but nice the only option for Star travellers in Mumbai. Staff welcoming and smiley. Food limited but more than just snacks. Could do with computer terminals in case you don't have a wifi device with you. Two let downs are it not having a flight screen at all in the lounge. Also they had a row of clocks for world time and had taken the Mumbai one down - I couldn't work out why if that one broke they didn't put the Singapore clock in its place and change its time.,4,0.550519389
R Deu,An older and smaller lounge of other Lufthansa lounges at Frankfurt. It is packed at all times and even if service is constant (bar and food) it is impossible to relax and have a seat. The venue is not at all in accordance with today's traveller. Staff should avoid having drinks and snacks from the passenger area and consumed at the front desk.,4,0.550519389
G Graham,The Star Alliance lounge at CDG in terminal  near gates - is downstairs. The space proved to be comfortable and quiet with a very good selection of snacks drinks and sandwiches.,4,0.550519389
C James,It was a not up to par with Emirates/Qatar lounges it is very hard to find. The personal assistants are not all equal ours was not very good. You can not get a VAT refund for merchandise purchased that is considered carry-on. Beware of this fact. Breakfast area seemed busy and employees falling behind in servicing passengers. Quiet areas (non- cellphone areas) are not enforced and there was always someone talking everywhere even near the quiet relaxing chairs with blankets. Limo service to your flight you better request or demand the car you want when you arrive. They put my wife and I in a Minivan with two strangers Business class HON members. I felt this Terminal relative to my experiences around the world with others such as Qatar SIA etc was very poor. There are many Business class lounges that are better than Lufthansa's First Class Terminal experience.,3,-0.232618709
S Blumenthal,Good lounge with great views. Selection of simple sandwiches and variety of drinks including alcoholic beverages. This lounge can get really crowded though with people lining up in front of the elevators.,4,0.550519389
E Rehm,"Small Lounge no bathrooms no showers no baggage storage. Every drink has to be ordered at the bar you have to wait for the staff to show up. After several minutes of waiting for the Barkeeper I finally ordered  Cokes for me and my friend. When she asked me if I'd want anything else I asked for  additional Cokes as we were very thirsty and didn't know if she was going to leave again. Her answer: ""you can have one and have to come back to get another one"". Avoid that uncomfortable place with rude staff!",2,-1.015756808
William Dunn,I splurged on business class tickets to take my  yr old mother to Russia. A reason for going business class was to have a comfortable place to wait during layovers in Frankfurt. What a mistake! The business class lounges were so crowded people were waiting in line to get in. Inside there was a cattle car feeling with no place to sit and no fresh air. I was mortified that my mother was forced to sit out in the airport lobby after I had promised her the luxury of business class. Never again Lufthansa!,2,-1.015756808
Steven Curfs,Compared to some time ago the lounges have improved . Instead of haribo sweets and beer they now offer simple sandwiches hot food desserts variety of cold dishes as well as a good choice in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Staff friendly and good storage space. I think the main problems however are that a lot of people can make use of the lounges and they are overcrowded. Also a limited budget for the food and beverage service is evident. The lounge offered seating free wifi a drink and a nibble and storage for luggage.,4,0.550519389
K Athens,Mediocrity is the word that comes to mind. In terms of food the quality is subpar - it is horrible if you are a vegetarian. Quality of drinks is also below average. The seats are not comfortable and there is an air of tightness and inability to move around effortlessly. To me two positives stood out - the shower was wonderful (some toiletries provided) and the storage area to lock your handbags so you don't have to take them around. This is not a nice lounge.,2,-1.015756808
T Smith,"Visited this Senator lounge located at Gate B arriving at around noon. After visiting the Senator lounge at Gate A a week previously I was expecting the worst (cramped no seats available should be used as a broom closet etc). When I entered the lounge I was pleasantly surprised. This lounge is huge and was filled only to about % capacity. Very spacious and clean you aren't cramped. Although the lounge did fill up while I was there seats were available. The breakfast food was fine and plentiful and beverage selection is what you'd expect in a lounge. The staff were pleasant
G O'Neill,This is the main hub of Lufthansa surely the most frequently used Senator Lounge in their entire network and yet it's tiny totally cramped and has absolutely no imagination style or flare in their decor at all. It looks like a cafeteria in an office building in s Germany. When i arrived there were no seats at all available and I was forced to stand around waiting for  mins before I could even sit down. And the food was just very German (Bavarian) meat dishes with a cold creamy potato salad being the only vegetarian option in the whole place. Only  tv screen in one corner with no sound and I cant believe in another corner is a LCD display only showing tv advertising!! Having just come from the fantastic modern beautifully designed Senator lounge at JFK this feels like an economy lounge for Easyjet.,3,-0.23261870920862976
G O'Neill,Beautiful Lounge well designed modern and well catered by polite and efficient staff. Food quality was excellent. Probably one of the best lounges I've been in for ages.,5,1.3336574878175844
M Norton,Our flight from JFK landed half an hour early and there were many of us waiting outside for a considerable amount of time before the staff begrudgingly opened the lounge. One wonders if they knew we were coming! Showers are gorgeous food is acceptable but lounge staff attitude appalling. Such a contrast to other airline arrival lounges where they cannot do enough to help.,3,-0.23261870920862976
R Jan van Pelt,Malaysia Airlines use the Air France Salon PremiÃ¨re lounge at Charles De Gaulle Airport Terminal . The lounge itself is nothing special with very limited selection of food and drinks and no toilets (have to go outside)  but coffee and croissants/pain au Chocolat for breakfast are pretty decent. What's more important is that when you are travelling on a MAS flight as oneworld Sapphire Card holder MAS tries to send you to the dreadful ICare lounge. I was there for one minute and felt like cattle in a market. Literally no seats available and an extremely small space to manoeuvre. But oneworld Sapphire can also enter La PremiÃ¨re and that would give you at least a more humane experience.""",5,1.333657488
G Jackers,I have been so appalled by the dismal Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at the A-Gates in Frankfurt that I felt the need to write a review. First and foremost the room was so hopelessly overcrowded there was barely a single free seat! Food offering is not just bad it is simply non-existent (if you like me don't consider peanuts a muffin and a slice of bread as a food offering). The overcrowding coupled with the sadly decreasing levels of etiquette and many people talking loudly on cell phones leads to simply unbearable noise levels. Slow wireless internet is available and is free but I can't imagine that anyone could get any serious work done in this type of environment. Highly unpleasant a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
R Mundra,Been to  different business class lounges Mumbai and Munich. To be honest there is nothing much to offer. The lounges are overcrowded and the food is nothing great. To add internet access at Munich is not free! Also no reclining seats so no comfort to the back or neck at transit airports like Munich.,3,-0.232618709
S Ley,Incredible service very attentive friendly and professional! Overall a most pleasant experience and a huge difference to most other airport lounges.,5,1.333657488
Colin Steven,"Oh what a difference a few years makes. On visiting this lounge in  I thought it was one of the best I had been through, not this time. Tired, lights not working, food selection nothing like it used to be. Limited selection of drinks. Messy and unclean. Rest rooms that were filthy, no hand dryer that worked, and no paper towels. Lots of staff doing very little - well doing nothing. Lots of seating and that is one of the few positives, other than decent wi-fi. I have been a champion for Malaysia Airlines for a number of years, and I can see there is a whole world of challenges for the new CEO. This time around I cannot recommend using the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge in the International Satellite Building. I've used the Priority ""paid"" lounge and that was  times better than the Golden Wing Lounge, which is sad to say.",3,-0.232618709
G Morgan,Thought this lounge was below par because there are no dedicated bathroom facilities. The guest relations person was very helpful but it is not all about that is it!,2,-1.015756808
G Morgan,What a shocker! Confusing and overall a general lack of customer service. From the disinterested staff on the reception desk to the very poor washroom facilities. Food choices limited and overall a disappointing experience!,2,-1.015756808
Herst Berger,"Awful place. Not recommended. Dirty. Complimentary wifi requires red club membership. Very basic snacks. Not even close to the very basic business class standards. Try to avoid. Too pitiful Lufthansa partners with the guys to offer their ""business"" lounge to its passengers.",1,-1.798894906
Jan Merwe,I must confirm that the Lufthansa Business class lounges (visited  at Frankfurt and one in Johannesburg ) are the worst without any doubt of any airline. If you are hungry visit a restaurant at the airport as the best Lufthansa has to offer is a huge bread roll with two coin sized slices of polony/fake ham. Queued for a toilet. Waited  min for a shower.,2,-1.015756808
B Hamilton,One word terrible. Munich lounge Friday evening over crowded shabby and a disgrace to an alleged  star airline. One to be avoided at all costs.,2,-1.015756808
Shane Walker,I recently travelled with Malaysia Airlines to and from Paris and so had the misfortune of using the iCare (OneWorld) Business lounge in CDG terminal . What a dump! Very small with old worn out couches. No Television or newspapers disgusting food and coffee no departure information screen and staff who are friendly but unable to know how to mix a simple drink. There are also no showers or change rooms and the toilets are outside of the lounge and shared by all of the business lounges. Definitely one of the worst Oneworld lounges I have used anywhere. But it does match with the rest of CDG airport which is also poorly designed badly maintained and very user unfriendly.,2,-1.015756808
P Taylor,"Very ordinary particularly if you like a glass of wine and internet that is better than dial up. The general feel is ok until you get down to detail. First the bar which is not self serve and even beer is neither on display or available for self selection. As for red wine "" we only have merlot"" of a very ordinary kind. There is a first class lounge apparently at the ""satellite"" wherever that is but you won't be told about it in the main terminal unless you ask even if you are eligible. There is a definite don't care attitude in this place and as others have commented the showers and toilets are usable but not great. The food is ok and you can get freshly cooked noodles but it is pretty tasteless. Nothing here to encourage me to use MH or KL as a preferred hub but I guess I am spoilt with my regular regional being SQ with its very superior Singapore hub.",2,-1.015756808
David Harrison,In most respects this lounge is adequate. The WiFi is outrageously bad. On st April I got  Kbps download. Impossible to download even one email. Two other nearby pax complained. I went to reception where the agent said she gets so many complaints management doesn't act and please fill out a complaint form. MH management - are you listening? Go down the street and buy a decent router. Subscribe to a decent broadband service. Stop mucking around and deliver - most of us in this lounge are on business and internet is vital.,3,-0.232618709
Nayef Al-Haddad,Terminal A : Had to go there since the only business lounge available was this. Very crowded couldn't find a single seat! I could swear that some were leaning on sofa chairs for rest till somebody leaves a spot. Not a single item of food was visible only draft beer. We had to leave since no seat was available and it was better to get some food outside. I wouldn't dream of coming here again. Terminal B a lot more spacious than the one in A. More food selection (bread vegetable noodle soup cream cheese/Butter olives and pickles) and soft drinks/beer is provided. A single inch-something monitor was only available. Good selection of newspapers (they had chinese/arabic newspapers as well I was surprised). An okay lounge but it would need more improvement on the food bar selection. Both lounges you have to pay for Wi-Fi.,3,-0.232618709
M Grima,Lounge was over crowded and there was no where for me to sit. Wifi was not free which is joke and of the computers that offered 'Free Wifi' I was unable to log into any of my email accounts - the internet just didn't work. Onboard I was promised 'free breakfast at the business class lounge' on arrival at the airport should I choose not to eat on the plane. Imagine my disappointment when all that was available was asparagus soup - that tasted like dish water. Coming off an overnight flight from the US and waiting to connect to another flight I expected better food to be waiting for me and at least a place to sit and be able to check my emails also.,2,-1.015756808
J Aberg,Spent half-an-hour in this lounge yesterday and I thought that it was very much in line with the typical Lufthansa offering. Even food and snacks feel standardized across the world when you travel Lufthansa! I liked the good location close to the gates and pleasant staff. I disliked the bulky and complicated way to get Internet Access and the computers in the lounge should have been sent to a museum about ten years ago!,3,-0.232618709
J Fairclough,There have clearly been some attempts to upgrade this place since I was last there  years ago but without too much success  it has to be said. Another of those huge impersonal lounges that can get crowded. Without wishing to be snobbish this seems to be as a result of allowing access to non Biz/First class passengers who are on other airlines' FF lists or have just bought passes for cash. I suppose the rather bizarre almost 'speakeasy' hidden alcohol bar is a sop to the religious people in the country and the choice/quality is OK but no more. Also food is adequate without being impressive. Seating is reasonably comfortable but the toilets/showers are starting to show their age. To be quite honest the MAS Business class lounge in the domestic part of the terminal is a far nicer experience less impersonal better seating and food (including an absolutely fantastic malay chicken curry). OK they do not pretend to serve alcohol (as on their domestic flights) but at least you know where you stand.,3,-0.232618709
Paddy Clarke,A surprisingly poor offering from MAS. This lounge is large poorly arranged (seats in lines and very closely spaced) dirty poorly equipped and in dire need of renovation. There is a small bar near the entrance which serves a very limited selection of alcoholic drinks (no self service) including a couple of poor quality wines beer and no champagne or spirits. The bar also closes early regardless of the number of passengers in the lounge. Hot food was cold and there was a very limited selection. Hot drinks machines were poor but there was a serviced coffee bar with a good selection of coffees and teas made to order. WiFi so slow it was next to useless. Overall very poor - looking forward to the Emirates Lounge reopening after refurbishment.,1,-1.798894906
D Egginton,There is a Golden Lounge located in both terminals. This I found out after being directed to the satellite terminal by airport staff when I could have stayed in the main terminal. I preferred the main terminal lounge. The food was of good quality with hot and cold options. I arrived just before the change over from breakfast to lunch. There is a bar but you are made to feel awkward as it's hidden away. The tables are not cleared very often however and there was only a cold shower available.,3,-0.232618709
Anthony Harrison,"Overcrowded at first but it cleared out as I had four hours to wait on my flight. This is the only lounge I have seen within the Star Alliance group to charge for internet usage. That is just stupid. As always the staff are unpleasant and unhelpful. When I asked if I could get a wireless card with a password I was told and I quote: ""Yes. Your Credit Card."" very succinctly. I have to agree with most of the reviews I have seen so far - chairs are uncomfortable it can be very crowded and the two tiny elevators allowing access to the lounge are ridiculous and slow. All of the Star Alliance airlines need to get together and take a course from Singapore Airlines on how to run a proper lounge. Services are so inconsistent across all of the airlines that it's almost comedic.",2,-1.015756808
T Speers,Overcrowded mess. The worst thing is that the only way to get in or out (barring a fire) is through two tiny and slow elevators. I was shocked when I was trying to go to my plane and I had to wait for a long line to clear just to get out. I'm sure people have missed their flights because of that set up.,2,-1.015756808
John Prince,"As I write I am sitting in this lounge. Of course I cannot use my own computer unless I pay  euros per hour :  booths are provided free so one waits for one of these to be unoccupied. The business class lounge is better than this one a better selection of food and drinks and some (not all) of the staff make an effort to please. Here for lunch there is a selection of nibbles and one dish. There are  wines on offer  of which are inferior ""Methode"" sparkling whites: the best is a medium grade red rioja. The showers are fine provided you use them late afternoon. If you wait until just before a late flight as is normal they are crowded. When I think of the facilities offered in Changi I have to ask myself why SIA want to be in this alliance.",2,-1.015756808
D Egginton,Difficult when airlines use a generic airport lounge for a small number of business class passengers. The lounge is new but the food on offer wasn't appealing.,3,-0.232618709
G Duckworth,UseHaving used this lounge for the past  years to travel from KL to Beijing the time has come to switch to Singapore Airlines although more costly and a longer flight. The toilets today ( Mar ) were disgusting and unusable and clearly hadn't been cleaned for a while and the service in their so called sports bar was beyond comprehension. Clearly the airline is going through difficult times but surely now if the the time to do whatever is possible to increase the customers experience. I complained to two people in the lounge who really couldn't care and never made any attempt to apologize or have the toilets cleaned so enough is enough.,2,-1.015756808
Siti Malik,UseMy flight was  hours ahead and I spent my quality time waiting in this lounge. The environment was quiet and cozy. The food was absolutely delicious especially the beef rendang! I kept on refilling my plates while waiting. There's even a massage corner. However the WiFi was just average. But nevertheless I would definitely come again here! A very welcoming lounge.,4,0.550519389
K Ghorayeb,The lounge feels like a mess hall rather than a lounge. Wifi is not free the furniture is not comfortable and the place is overcrowded. As I type this I am sharing a small table with three other people who were scrambling for a seat. This place is comparable to an overcrowded bus in Cairo.,2,-1.015756808
William Kelly,Was on route to DUB via MUC had the chance to sample the Lufthansa lounge in IST. The best thing about this place is knowing you will be leaving. Dark and dirty are the two words that best capture the feel of this place. No external windows carpets and soft furnishings were well past their sell by date. The snacks and beverages were very average. Find it hard to think that Lufthansa would be happy to use this lounge going forward. The positive was that there was free Wi Fi.,2,-1.015756808
J Jensen,The decor is a bit cold and not very welcoming. The selection of food limited though the Oktober Fest special was a nice touch. The selection of drinks is varied and good. I find it really strange that Lufthansa does not offer free WiFi in their Senator lounges (nor the business class lounges). But the lounge is a welcome escape from the not very customer friendly Tegel airport. The staff at the front desk not very welcoming though I have had very good experiences at other times.,3,-0.232618709
Tiong WeiLiem,Even though it was a small lounge it was very cosy. There are good views of the tarmac as well. The staff were very polite. The whole lounge was very clean including the toilets. Maybe if there was one small thing I would pick on is to have more varieties of food. Other than that the lounge is wonderful and I would recommend it.,5,1.333657488
M Taggart,Used this lounge on the outward and inward trips LHR/Sydney. Spacious comfortable friendly staff. Shower facilities very adequate and clean. Quite a good choice of food and drinks - no problem with having a designated area for serving alcohol.,5,1.333657488
K Simpson,The lounge entrance is impressive & the reception staff welcoming once inside the lounge the furnishings looked cheap food selection was good. The wine selection terrible on offer was a cheap white red passable & champagne was good. This lounge is in need of an upgrade.,3,-0.232618709

Bruce Temkin,A bit disappointing. Stale bread watery fruit salad some nuts and a full freezer full of mini-ice creams - an odd mix of food! Wifi and computers were spotty but they did try to fix them immediately. Lounge was fairly comfortable if a bit drab and boring. Was starving but had to go outside to the airport where there were many good options to purchase food.,3,-0.232618709
Bruce Temkin,Shared lounge with SAS and has a very minimalist Scandinavian appeal. Nice variety of breads cold cuts cheeses fruit drinks (wine beer alcohol and soft drinks) etc. A few computer terminals magazines and fresh fruit scattered around.,4,0.550519389
Anders Pedersen,Spacious good views of lanes outside. Sleeping massage and shower facilities. Lounge is kept in dull brown colours. Good food inc.  options of hot dishes from Malay kitchen. Alcohol separated from lounge and referred to the entrance at a small side-room. Only Carlsberg beer - wines and  champagne available.,4,0.550519389
Mark Niall,We use this lounge twice a year on return flights to Europe. It does the job. However dispte some renovation recently it could do with better and more shower cubicles and also toilets. Quite often there is a wait for both. Food and drinks adequate. They do need to lift the lounge to bring it up to the standards expected. They operate a very good business class in their planes. They may have to spend some money to bring the lounge up to the standard of their aircraft.,4,0.550519389
O Werder,This lounge is an embarrassment. Staff is largely absent food is Lukewarm lounge is an open seating area in the mezzanine of Delhi International where the noise comes in unfiltered there are four old Win desktops WiFi requires a complex picture ID procedure and bathrooms are basically the same quality toilets you find anywhere in the airport (so forget freshening up). There is some premium Lounge next door but the difference in access to the two is unclear to me. At any rate lounges like this make me wonder whether I should fly this airline at all again. Hopefully their hub lounge in KL is better.,2,-1.015756808
B Cesare B,Very welcoming and polite staff nice catering big choice for hot and cold drinks. Alcohol included. Nice and comfortable relax space the lounge is big. There is also smoking room separate.,4,0.550519389
Henning Schaefer,Being quite spacious the lounge features several areas. A working area for laptop users a kind of bistro area and a spacious relaxation area with several TV screens. Two lavatories and two bars (with only one featuring the full variety of available snacks and drinks). Snacks include the usual cake and soup selections drinks include soft and hard beverages alongside two kinds of draught beer. Wireless internet is not available free of charge.,4,0.550519389
S Reiziger,The lounge was a joke! We flew a Star Alliance airline and was told that we could use Lufthansa business lounge. We had to walk very far from our gate go through a security check point to get to the lounge. Then later after we exited from the lounge we had to go through another security check point at our gate. That added up to a lot of time. We hope for a decent cup of coffee but it was terrible coming out of a coffee machine. A few cups of yogurt on a tray open to all sneezing customers. Sandwiches were made with old bread as hard as rock! No free internet connection! We will not go to this lounge again and will complain to our airline.,1,-1.798894906
Nick Wilcock,The standard and variety of food and beverages available in this Gold Card-only lounge continue to deteriorate. The furniture isn't particularly comfortable working space is cramped and the whole ambience of the place is very run down and second rate. Presumably it's because Lufthansa spend all their resources pandering to the first class lounge users and do not see their Gold Card holders as meriting much in the way of service. It used to be a lot better,,
Laurence McCarthy,MAS continues to do what it does well - disappoint. How hard can it be to keep a place clean have staff who want to help food that is worth eating and provide alcohol without guests feeling like they should not drink alcohol. Seems all of this is impossible for MH. Perhaps one needs to have to have a different mindset to truly appreciate Malaysian Hospitality?,2,-1.015756808
P Chong,Used the lounge while waiting for flight to Auckland. Spacious yes - impressed no. At the front desk beyond asking for the boarding pass frontline staff seem to assume that everyone who came knew what the Golden Lounge had to offer. No attempt to explain its facilities. Upon entering you come upon the room where liquor is served but it was small and so far from everything else. Sofa seats were arranged in lines and close together. Buffet choices very limited. Everything was self service much like a canteen. Glasses so small probably to discourage one from taking too much thus necessitating frequent trips for refills. I stood there for  glasses of juice before I moved off with a th. That's how small the glasses were. Tables while cleared of glasses and plates were not wiped down. I saw just one staff clearing tables. I did not realise there was  other counters serving food. There was no signboard to the shower/washrooms. Inside the shower stalls were not clean bits of hair left behind and why is the floor in the shower area level with the changing area. Good thing my shoes were near the outer door or they would have been soaked. After what you read in the Malaysia Airlines web page this was a disappointment you've oversold yourself. Come on MAS you can do better than this.,2,-1.015756808
Ronald Egerton,Suffice to say it was quite ordinary. All cold not covered food. Seats were comfortable is the best I can say.,3,-0.232618709
Pawel Litwinski,The lounge is small and due to Lufthansa expansion in Milan it turns very overcrowded. About pm no place to seat at all. Only  PC's available in the whole lounge. Some cold snacks (good Italian cheese some sandwiches fruit salad) standard selection of drinks. No toilets inside.,2,-1.015756808
R Jones,Super lounge continues to uphold their high standards. Great food and beverage options decent WiFi excellent showers and best of all superb service. The professional staff treats all passengers with grace and efficient charm. The private security area is a breeze and the limo ride to the plane is always a treat whereas the van ride falls short of first class expectations.,5,1.333657488
S Kothari,Hon circle lounge at Frankfurt is very spacious and tastefully appointed lounge. Sit down restaurant area with excellent food options full bar with bar tender. Separate cigar / smoking room. Well appointed showers and SPA in the lounge. To board the flight you take a elevator to the ground level quick security check and Lufthansa drives you directly to the gate.,5,1.333657488
V Tee,Was looking to experience this so called MH flagship lounge. But I only found great disappointments once I arrived there. The newly renovated lounge had a cheap mess hall or school canteen feel to it as the chairs and tables were plonked in lines and rows in a big open area (not to mention the bland high ceiling) to maximize the capacity. As a result no 'personal space' and very crowded as everybody was close to each other. Chairs not comfy. No sign to the toilets had to ask staff for it. The toilet was so basic and small. Food selection adequate but not extensive. It's understandable due to their religion practice they set up the bar way off the main dining area and very close to the main entrance and had a walk a fair bit to get a glass of drinks. Internet was fast and reliable. Overall I was not impressed with this -star lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Laurence McCarthy,Upgrading lounge so 'temporary' lounge is in a grotty couple of rooms next to Starbucks. Check In staff didn't even mention that the real lounge was closed. Almost no airport staff knew where the lounge was and the only sign is a hand written a sheet taped to the door. Catering was awful alcohol none existent and staff very stand offish.,2,-1.015756808
Dean Potaka,After a flight into KLIA from PER I was looking forward to using their flagship lounge to freshen up and relax before continuing onto LHR late that evening. What a let down. Trying to find a seat was the first obstacle my wife and I encountered and when we finally did trying to locate staff to clean the area was our next. Requesting use of the showers was met with a courteous and immediate response of yes. However when I entered through the doors it was like the area had not been serviced since the first flight of the day. No toilet tissue to be found unless you raided every cubicle prior. And the floors needed a hose down. Showers only saving grace was that the water pressure and temperature was very good as they were not very clean to begin with. With half an hour before boarding MH to LHR I decided to have a drink at the bar by the entrance to lounge. Selections are only average at best with no champagne only a French sparkling but that was no bother as I knew the best was to come on board. To wrap up the experience of what is meant to be their flagship lounge I have noticed its gradual decline since I first started using this service on numerous occasions since . I will be returning from LHR mid Jan and look forward to experiencing the Golden Lounge of Terminal  as I have heard great reviews of this one. Will keep you all posted.,2,-1.015756808
Tim Keane,"The intercom button is still a challenge to find at the ground level entrance. Food selection was very good
W Chia,This lounge is new in terminal C and looks like a canteen. No style at all. Drink choice average food almost non existing. Only nice touch is that it has a direct boarding gate for business passengers. Lounge staff just sit at the door checking if you are qualified to enter. No free wi-fi and this is what I don't understand. It is  now and internet is a part of our and still you have to pay  euros for an hour. Lufthansa should be really reconsider the passengers need. The lounge is just gate with some bigger chairs a table with drinks and so called food.,2,-1.0157568077217367
Roland Buecheler,The lounge was totally crowded with many people standing and not having a seat. Passengers with luggage were bumping into seated travellers while trying to find a space to sit down. Small tables and uncomfy seats. Mediocre food just some awesome sandwiches. As the Star Alliance grows someone would expect an adjusted lounge to cater for the increased number of business and first class traveller. Staff tried hard to clean tables but had a hard time to get glasses and plates back to the kitchen.,2,-1.0157568077217367
S Brodie,The business class lounge upstairs in the satellite terminal (that I have visited earlier this year) was closed. The temporary lounge was difficult to find and small with no shower facilities and unwelcoming unhelpful staff. The lounge was cramped and there were no shower facilities and limited food options. So I asked the staff if there was another business class lounge was given confusing instructions by a disinterested & slightly rude staff member and told to go back on the train to the main terminal to the """"regional"""" business class lounge (for international and domestic flights). The regional lounge was completely full. Nonetheless after a wait I was able to take a shower in the short time left before my flight. The washroom staff were disinterested and no towels were provided (I used paper towels to dry myself). After having spent my time locating the various lounges there was no time for food and I had to take the train back to the satellite terminal for my flig ht. Once at the gate there was no announcement for business class boarding so I ended up boarding with the rest of the flight. Never again - unacceptable for business class.""",1,-1.798894906
M Cunningham,I used the KLIA lounge in transit and was impressed. If in transit stay in the Satellite building and head upstairs when you reach the air train - it isn't incredibly well signposted. It is large with plenty of natural light via big windows it has lockers newspapers magazines and many seating areas. There was a business centre with helpful staff. Lounge PCs offer internet and printing. Excellent range of food included noodles and soups barista made coffees and full range of teas fresh fruit plus I saw a variety of other dishes. There are several food service areas - all have different offerings. There is a bar with limited choices but white wine they offered was fine. Bathrooms with amenity packs and had hot showers both times - they are at the far end of the lounge and staff will give you towels and packs with shampoo etc.,5,1.333657488
R Jones,On our way to Bali we used the KL first class lounge and it was great but on return th November it was closed - no reason given but everyone was herded into a small holding lounge to sit out the time. My partner was trying to do some business calls but very difficult sitting neck to jowl with all the other guests. Avoid KL lounge if you can until the closure time is over.,2,-1.015756808
John Kotsopoulos,What a disappointment. This is a small dreary and window-less lounge packed full with passengers awaiting the Frankfurt and Munich departures (leave within minutes of each other). We couldn't find a seat despite arriving in the lounge almost two hours before departure. There are no showers which could have been a nice touch considering the flights to Germany leave at around am - an awkward time meaning that most passengers would have long ago checked out of their hotels and be in need of a freshening up particularly after a day of touring hot and humid Mumbai. At least wifi is free (unlike Lufthansa lounges in Frankfurt!).,3,-0.232618709
James Halley,Thai is the lounge used for passengers flying on star alliance carriers. Drink selection good but food was simply awful. The noodles were gobbled up so quickly that the staff couldnt keep the dish full! Internet ok and the lounge chairs have been replaced and at least look the part even if some are not particularly comfortable. Not up to the standard I have come to expect from TG lounges.,4,0.550519389
Chris Joynes,Borderline rude staff with more than a slightly condescending attitude and manner. A definite feeling of everything was too much trouble. However once in the lounge the â€“ mostly Asian â€“ staff were relatively friendly and efficient but still lacking. The atmosphere in this very spacious lounge is pleasant and relaxing and knocks spots off any lounge in FRA with the exception of the F Class Terminal. I arrived at : pm. and only awful-smelling soup and the remains of crisps nuts and the like could be found. At  pm. hot snacks were brought out and were surprisingly tasty. Drinks selection is moderately good. Armchairs with low tables and CafÃ©-style tables and chairs are available and are kept quite clean. Toilet area clean. Internet access and WLAN. Overall a pleasant experience and a much much better transfer airport and lounge than FRA.,3,-0.232618709
D Manau,Lounge had a soft lighting to it being better than the domestic lounge at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It's not big but accommodated well for  to  flights. Food choices were poor and cheap though: they offered rice meat and vegetables that were simply foreign for the locals. No western cuisine. Seating area was a tad dense in arrangement. A lounge that fits it purpose and a better offering compared to the one at its hub in Kuala Lumpur.,3,-0.232618709
Barry Manners,A long queue to enter the lounge which I simply by-passed rather than stand in line for  minutes. Inside the lounge was crowded. Seats are small and cheap looking. My search for a virgin mary was fruitless. No worcester sauce no tabasco no lemon juice etc. I tried a chicken stew which was cold. I left and paid for my own drinks in the main terminal rather than spend any time in the dreary uncomfortable surroundings.,2,-1.015756808
G Harris,The lounge is operated by a third party supplier and is shared by numerous airlines. The seating was barely adequate for the number of people present when we were there in the late morning. Facilities are fairly ordinary and the range of catering is limited.,3,-0.232618709
Bruce Jahnke,Worst business class lounge I have ever experienced. Uncomfortable chairs dirty carpet and horrible food service. The front desk receptionists were rude and there is no wireless internet.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Schweizer,Lufthansa should be ashamed to offer such a dump to their and their star alliance partner business class passengers. Old and run-down furniture empty plates remained on tables for long time and filthy carpets gave me the impression I was sitting in a run-down train station. Only potato salad and some sort of meat dumplings on offer and standard drinks at the self service counter. Lounge (above my SQ flights departure gate B ) offers nice views of the tarmac but the outdoor viewing area is closed and appears to be closed some time already due to the weeds growing outside. Why wasn't I surprised that no free wireless internet was available but you had to pay for WIFI. Do have to point out that the shower facilities were flawless and very clean and well maintained. This lounge is a major embarrassment for LH in their home hub.,1,-1.798894906
R Ganbich,The lounge is at the very far end of the finger with most intra-Schengen flights and it might well take up to  minutes to reach and then the same amount of time again to go to the connection gate. The lounge is very crowded even more crowded than some of the public seating areas one passes on the long way there. Drinks selection is good food is bewilderingly low- standard:e. Newspaper selection good lounge not provide free wireless internet.,2,-1.015756808
R Arnett,Lounge was quite big with lots of seating. Food was average at best. Washrooms were in very bad condition and not cleaned and organised. No hot water for a shower is unacceptable in a business class lounge!,3,-0.232618709
Andrew Spooner,Big open-plan lounge that was noisy slightly chaotic and with few quiet spaces to sit and relax. Food was very average and having to queue to get a cup of tea seemed arcane. The air-con wasn't working very well when I was there and it was quite hot and uncomfortable. Furniture looked old and worn as did carpets. The lounge also allowed open entry for  Malaysian Ringgit - which seems to defeat the purpose a bit.,3,-0.232618709
Y Ren,I have been through MH first lounge at KL international airport twice last month. It is a really good lounge. Staff are very friendly and professional always ready to help. Lounge is not big but never crowded when I was there. You can sit down order some proper meals. Great wine and drink selections available. There is also a buffet area you can get the food you like. No spa available in the lounge. Shower is in the bathroom. You can get the tower and amenity from a little counter before get in the bathroom. Good internet connection as well. It is not Qantas first lounge in Sydney but very good lounge for transit passengers.,3,-0.232618709
R Ganbich,A good lounge experience. Centrally located quite spacious relaxed and very clean. Furniture a bit on the sturdy side. Nice staff good views a very good drinks selection. Food less impressive. Very good newspaper selection. Had troubles connecting to internet on my own computer.,4,0.550519389
Jeff Michel,Appalling lounge about  seats small no windows even the staff are embarassed by this truly awful lounge. Good selection of drinks and some snacks but this has to rate as the worst lounge I have been in. Flying SWISS First Class but you have to use this lounge as SWISS do not have their own at Boston. Avoid at all costs!,2,-1.015756808
David Martin,Arrived at am from CAN and was departing at am. Terminal  lounge not ready drinks only. No cold meats nothing - cold soup though! And in true Lufthansa style no free WiFi! When are they going to get into the sr century. Terrible dire. No more Lufthansa flights for me.,2,-1.015756808
F Wong,This is not a brand new lounge but with nice decor and great selection of food and courteous staffs. Very speedy and free wifi connection stations for charging mobile phones provided. Bathroom facilities clean and sufficient. A nice place to kill a few hours during transfer as they are not much to see and buy at KLIA.,4,0.550519389
Andy Green,The Golden Lounge at Singapore Terminal  is basic with a small food and beverage selection and no views to speak of but it was nice and quiet when I visited (.pm-.pm). There is free WiFi which was very fast I'm not sure how it compares when the lounge is busy. There was a good selection of soft drinks and juices but you have to hunt around for the alcohol (cans of Tiger/Heineken and a wine bottle hidden behind an opaque-doored section of one of the small fridges). Restrooms were clean with shower facilities and towels available. Overall not the best but fine for a short stay.,4,0.550519389
T Toronyi,Service in this lounge is average there seems to be a constant queue for a shower which is not managed particularly well. The bathroom is poorly maintained in terms of cleanliness and also general condition.,3,-0.232618709
M Schaar,"I had to ""borrow"" the Internet from the British Airways lounge next door as the only offering the LH lounge had was a pay-by-the-hour t-Mobile connection (nice partnership guys). Many business class customers couldn't even find a seat - you'd think they'd design a lounge to accommodate a - customer base but apparently not. Plus no windows? I felt like I was in a doctor's office waiting area. Its only saving grace was the ample supply of wine beer and champagne.",2,-1.015756808
Natalie Edwards,We had a lot of hassle with Lufthansa checking onto our flight. Madrid - Munich - Hong Kong. Their staff do not know how to read E-Tickets anyway once that was sorted I was looking forward to spending some time in the Star Alliance lounge before our flight. However it was not a pleasant experience. The food was peanuts chips club sandwiches and a couple of muffins. The drinks selection was very limited. No bubbles. And the internet was not working. Not a nice lounge at all.,1,-1.798894906
J Kenney,The lounge is only open to premium passengers from intercontinental flights and elite members of Lufthansa's Frequent Flyer programme (no Star Alliance or partner flights keeping the lounge uncrowded. Luggage stored upon arrival and put my name in for a shower at reception. Experience has taught me to wait for a long time for a shower in the arrivals lounges,,
R Gilbertson,We have used the KLIA lounge around  times (Adelaide to Europe) in the last few years. It is looking a bit faded and could do with an upgrade but the food is always adequate with respect to quality and variety staff clear the tables frequently and keep everything tidy and the toilets are always clean. Two complaints : It is usually impossible to get a hot shower the water being no better than warm no bath mat is provided and the showers are not wiped down after each use. On the plus side the towels provided are big and white and fluffy. A lot of the seats in the lounge don't have a power point close enough to plug in a laptop so a long wait for the next fight can use a lot of battery power.,4,0.550519389
Norzaidi Zahidin,What a tremendous disappointment. Hostess not exactly informed and showed a minimum degree of customer service the lounge was very small (shared by  Airlines!) coffee machine overflow when you try to get some zero hot food and they don't even restock the cheap croissant when its finished. And it was only am!,2,-1.015756808
P Fillery,"Arrived at the Lounge roughly . on Saturday. Friendly greeting but the lounge was manic and very busy. We had to work out how the system worked as we were not told by the reception staff even though we said we had never visited the Lounge before. Once we figured out the food (hot snacks and cold assortment) and the drinks system, we sat down. The only downside was the air conditioning - it wasn't working. They had very large fans trying to cope with the very hot atmosphere in the Lounge (the lounge faces south with glass windows) but because of the high temperatures, they really couldn't cope. Overall, not a relaxing experience at this time.",4,0.550519389
P Fillery,Entered lounge at . hours on a Saturday. Lounge was very restful and welcoming. Not shown what to do but soon worked it out. Good selection of drinks and snacks available. Lounge was very calming and relaxing - just what we needed before a long flight. This is a good lounge and would recommend it.,6,2.116795586
Suhail Kazim,Lufthansa has just recently opened its first arrivals lounge in Frankfurt airport. Its open for premium passengers as well as elite loyalty card holders arriving on long haul flights. Its open from am until . pm and is located just outside the exit of baggage in Terminal B. It was bright and staff took care of my luggage and stored it in a secure area. The reception asked me if I needed a shower and directed me to the shower area downstairs. When I went down another staff directed me to the shower room and it was nice to see a welcome note displaying my name on a LCD screen in the shower room! The shower was delightful and had heated granite floors rainforest shower heads Occitane toiletries etc. There was an extensive breakfast buffet with hot items like scrambled eggs pancakes waffles etc and fired eggs could be ordered too. Cup noodles available on request. A lot of cold items like cereals cold cuts cheese etc . Ample dining space free internet via computer terminal snooze areas were other features of lounge. Overall Lufthansa has done an excellent job here and this lounge is far superior than its existing lounges in the departure area.,5,1.333657488
M Rapp,Nice new design but always very crowded. Entrance is shared with Business Lounge and toilets are only available in the Business Lounge. Excellent drink selection but food selection is a little bit chaotic. They have a lot of stuff which not really fits together and especially the salads are low-quality convenience products with tons of mayonaise. Only limited offer of cake sweets or chocolate. Extensive offer of national and international newspapers. Actually they had set up a smoothy bar where a bartender made fresh smoothies. Quite a nice idea although the noise of the fruit mixer was quite disturbing.,3,-0.232618709
M Rapp,The lounge is very small with limited facilities and space. Still the old design which looks a little bit outdated. Drink selection okay but food selection really poor.,3,-0.232618709
L Crawford,Huge lounge with no character - like a school canteen. None of the finesse expected of a business lounge. All self service poor choice of food - only kind of eggs is scrambled which sit for ages on a hotplate. Hot breakfast choice - chicken sausage scrambled egg and baked beans only. The dining tables and chairs were in the cold buffet section - the low coffee tables and armchairs were the seats for the hot food - who designed this nonsense? At am the lounge was not busy but dirty plates cups uneaten food covered the tables. Supervisors just walked past without comment - disgusting. A very disappointing experience at Malaysia's main airport. The only place in Malaysia where the food quality and service has been poor.,2,-1.015756808
L Crawford,"Excellent service excellent food. Smiles all round from the staff - the chef even made me a Pecan Pastry specially! Very relaxed ambience. Malaysian Airlines at their home base airport of Kuala Lumpur should follow the London example - not the ""school canteen"" style they provide in the KUL business lounge.",5,1.333657488
Matthew Duncan,The lounge atmosphere is quite pleasant but there are no windows which makes the lounge feel a little dark and boxed in. The choice of food and drink was okay. Unfortunately the WIFI connection was very poor and I wasn't able to do work on my laptop that I needed to do before the flight. The printer in the computer room wasn't working either which was also frustrating.,3,-0.232618709
Gavin Lightley,What a difference to the old airside lounge and temporary lounge at Cologne airport! Very good selection of food and drinks with plenty of seating even on a Friday evening. If only all Lufthansa lounges could be like this. This was the Senator/Star Alliance Gold Lounge upstairs so can't comment on the business lounge downstairs but I was impressed at last by a Lufthansa lounge.,4,0.550519389
Mark Gilbert,Lounge has seating for about  pax but on my visit there were  of us comfortable seating nice selection of sandwiches and fruit and a full bar service. The downside to this lounge is having to go into the main Terminal to use the bathroom which was not very clean.,4,0.550519389
W Williams-Powell,We found the lounge to be cosy relaxing and the staff excellent. The facilities were very nice we would definitely use this again.,5,1.333657488
M Mead,Arrived in KL at am connecting flight out at am so would have loved a few hours sleep but the rest room was occupied maybe some more beds could be provided as there are often transiting passengers waiting. However a shower change of clothes and breakfast was much appreciated. Lounge was clean and comfortable but not so clean on our return trip home.,3,-0.232618709
J Teoh,Excellent lounge with a good selection of food. The lounge was clean spacious and comfortable. Staff very courteous. No alcohol available due to it being a domestic lounge. Loved the decor. Great view of the tarmac too.,5,1.333657488
Paul O'Brien,Mid may - and the Golden Lounge is closed - one assumes for renovation. The alternative offered the China Airline Lounge is uncomfortable poorly staffed crowded totally lacking in toilet facilities yet alone showers. Very Poor planning on the part of Malaysia Airlines. They surely could have arranged a better temporary alternative in their Home Airport.,2,-1.015756808
Dee Wilson,We have used this lounge before and thought it good but not on the late evening of May  this year. I looked around for a bar and finding nothing but a few oddments on a makeshift bar area asked a staff member for help. To my great surprise I was told there was no wine no gin and precious little of anything else! The staff member was curt and unhelpful to the point of being rude walking away while I asked the questions - after six weeks in a country of courteous people this discourtesy astounded me. My husband asked a senior staff member if we could have a glass of wine and was told that the airline was having difficulty getting alcohol through customs. A further problem was that the announcements in the lounge were virtually inaudible so keeping an eye on the departure board was essential. MAS pride themselves on their hospitality but it was sadly lacking in the business lounge that day.,2,-1.015756808
J Ashiblie,The Oberoi Lounge is shared by the major carriers (TG LH MI SQ W MH etc.) operating out of Chennai. During Peak Hours it is packed and if you arrive late you may not find a seat. The meal options can be described as dismal minimal and definitely most unappetizing. The non-alcoholic options too are somewhat limited. I settled for apple juice and dinner onboard the flight. It just makes me wonder why major airlines have chosen not to set up their own shared lounge.,2,-1.015756808
S Loft,"This lounge seemed to go for miles. Very pleasant and welcoming staff at the entrance and also throughout the lounge. Plenty of comfortable armchairs a large selection of food and beveridges plenty of bathrooms a ""quiet"" room for those needing a power nap free internet/wifi connection and for those desperates (like myself) a dedicated smoker's room hidden round a corner right down the back. The floor to ceiling windows provide a great view over the tarmac.",5,1.333657488
S Loft,Very comfortable and quiet lounge. Staff welcoming and friendly. Although it was late at night we were offered a large assortment of snacks finger food etc. and a light hot meal. Plenty of beveridges both hot and cold and a good choice of beers spirits and wines. Bathrooms were very clean with a nice selection of toiletries. A lovely preflight introduction to Malaysia Airlines famous hospitality.,4,0.550519389
S Martin,We were very disappointed and hope that Malaysian Airlines switch lounges. Hopefully there are others with better facilities and services in Rome Airport. At . am they had run our of clean glasses saying they were all broken. We had to wait for hot glasses from the dishwasher. There was no fruit just some indigestible pieces of foccacia type bread and defrosted rather tasteless sandwiches. Limited supply of juices. Where were the platters of lovely Italian meats and cheeses? The shower was broken. The coffee machine was broken. Only one bottle of wine in an ice bucket. it was a poorly run cafe with one overworked staff member in evidence rather than a business lounge for people who had paid a great deal of money.,2,-1.015756808
G Quincy,Quality of meals available the lounge seemed to have deteriorated since the last time I used in a few years ago. The hot meal selection was rather cheap. Beverage selection much better with good selection of drinks. Wireless access was slow. They should upgrade to a wider bandwidth. Reception staff were rather unprofessional. They were more keen to grounp around each other and play with their mobile phones. Not what is expected at a business class lounge.,3,-0.232618709
M Niall,Have used this lounge on many occasions. It is quite large and generally operates very well with adequate shower/bathroom facilities. On a recent trip were in the lounge from -. It was very crowded and not as comfortable or relaxing.,4,0.550519389
J Teoh,Small lounge in CDG terminal  (run by Air France?) shared by several airlines. It was quiet and felt reasonably spacious with a selection of snacks and pastries but no hot food. Comfortable seating provided. There was also a reasonable selection of beverages (soft and alcoholic). The main negative is that the toliets are outside of the lounge. There were several computers with internet access available throughout the lounge. I could not see any screens that provided flight details but staff made announcements when it was time for boarding.,3,-0.232618709
S Marley,Lounge is small but functional. Biggest set back was no toilets which was disappointing as the public toilets were dirty.,3,-0.232618709
Andrew Ward,First time in this relatively new lounge at T. Reasonable selection of food including hot dishes. Wines/champagne of decent quality but I prefer to serve myself or at least have the wines on display. Seating OK but a bit of an odd seating plan - sort of sofas surrounded by single chairs round the edge of the room if that makes sense - better than row after row of the same seats though.,4,0.550519389
William Ford,The lounge in KUL was the highlight of my Malaysia Airlines experience. it was comfortable well-stocked and even had a spa where you can get a reasonably priced massage if you have a longer layover.,4,0.550519389
J Teoh,An enormous lounge that provides plenty of comfortable seats with excellent views of the tarmac. There is a self-service bar for alcoholic beverages and soft drinks and a cafe for hot drinks where you can also order freshly prepared meals. The shower facilities were quite good too. Lounge staff were friendly and helpful. Free Wi-fi was provided and there were also a few computer stations with internet access for those who don't have laptops.,5,1.333657488

N Reeves,A very airy clean and spacious lounge located close to runways with excellent views. Lounge has very quiet atmosphere and is calming with plenty of seating. Excellent facilities with high standard of repair showers and rest rooms in immaculate order at time of our visit. Good choice of bakery and cold foods but hot food less appealing and with limited choice. Champagne and other drinks regularly offered by staff that provided great customer service. The best aspect of this lounge is when your flight is ready you are informed and personally escorted straight to the aircraft at Gate  a short lift ride away with no waiting or queuing whatsoever.,5,1.333657488
N Reeves,MH uses this lounge for their Biz Class passengers. Medium size lounge with easy access and views over the terminal from the first floor. Lounge quiet with soft lighting and good seating. Plentiful supply of reading material and access to departure info via screens. Internet desks available. Good choice of hot and cold food with hot food being constantly replenished. Good choice of beverages and alcohol. Rest rooms and showers in good order and clean. Staff very helpful and cleared surfaces quickly. Flights called over tannoy with short walk to departure gates.,4,0.550519389
Michael Barry,This is the worst business lounge I have ever been in. There was no fresh food on offer only pre packaged crackers and nuts. The only champagne on offer had a half glass of flat stale champagne in it and apart from that there was only one choice of beer and white wine for Air France you really would expect better. No internet service was offered when I asked I was told to log into my own Air France orange account. Not happy about that. The toilets looked like something out of a derelict Asian department store and accessed from outside the lounge very poor and unclean. The staff were not very welcoming and seemed more interested in getting passengers out of the lounge and to the gate rather than letting them relax. This experience will certainly affect future airline used to fly out of CDG Air France will never be a choice.,1,-1.798894906
Andy Baker,New Business Class Lounge at Heathrow T overlooks the Malaysia Gate (Gate ) - good seating area with plenty of drinks on offer. Food was of 'Malaysian' origin OK but not plentiful. Free WiFi.,5,1.333657488

D Dias,Access to this lounge was granted as part of my Business class ticket with Oman Air where I believe Oman Air reserve a small room as they don't have their own lounge. The a la carte food provided was good. However the buffet looked like it could have done with a rethink,,
R Macdonald,Excellent lounge for business class passengers. Very new small but well designed lounge with good facilities. The food and drinks on offer were well presented.,4,0.550519389
D Napper,As the main hub of the airline we found this lounge to be very good and serving it's customers well. Maybe a little frayed around the edges. We had no trouble gaining admission  hrs before flight and stayed there the whole time. Good selection of food drinks and reading material. Loved the ice-cream. Even when busy still seemed calm and tranquil. The golf putting room is a great idea and I am sorry did not get to try this. Nice view of the runways.,4,0.550519389
D Napper,Very quiet and east to find. Small range of food but what was there was quite tasty. Good selection of reading material. Beautiful bathrooms. Enjoyed the self service bar. Sure it could be better but there was only  flight leaving.,4,0.550519389
R Pullen,Fabulous service and amenities in this lounge. Food was plentiful presented well and tasty. The seating comfortable and the staff considerate helpful and courteous. A great way to start a journey!,5,1.333657488
R Pullen,Great service plentiful food which was well presented and tasty. Comfortable seating and good amenities.,5,1.333657488
U Crossley,Lounge in Bangkok is quite small yet cosy comfortable with a good supply and presentation of food beverages alcoholic and non alcoholic. Lounge in Muscat is fine but re facilities seating. Late night food presentation was not appetising. Breakfast on the return flight was very poor. Not even scrambled egg or anything plain. No toast. All was deep fried and spicy dishes or sweet. I can never connect to their wifi on my Galaxy tab.,4,0.550519389
Y Rahim,The regional lounge really nice. The food selection is quite good. Nice view where passenger can see the aircraft from a large window. Passenger also can order the food from the chef. The washroom really big and comfortable. They also have a small playground for kids.,5,1.333657488
Rhonda Brown,A huge negative is the selection of food or rather lack of. We traveled over a  week period & the only hot meal offered that was not a stir fry or curry was potato & leek soup. This did not change over the  weeks. The other food offered was average to say the least. At Kuala Lumpur Golden Lounge the only cheese to be eaten with the bountiful supply of crackers was cream cheese! Wraps bagels or small rolls & not much more.,4,0.550519389
Geoff Becque,Large lounge with areas for food drink working TV and resting. Showers newspapers magazines smoking room and quiet area as well as coffee machine. Alcohol (self serve) and snacks with hot food at appropriate times of the day. Seating is modern I doubt if I could doze in them. Staff helpful and as Bahrain is such a small airport all the gates are close. Decent enough lounge for a short stay with views over the airport.,4,0.550519389
Geoff Becque,An excellent lounge. Full restaurant facilities with wide selection of hot & cold food. Full bar inc fizz. Helpful and cheerful Filipino staff. Comfortable range of seating good toilets and full selection of newspapers and magazines. One of the better Business class lounges. A good experience. Note that Oman Air want to board their premium pax by executive bus so don't go to the gate too early or you will be sent back upstairs.,4,0.550519389
Geoff Becque,Oman Air Lounge shared with Gulf Air at DXB T. Although small it is well furnished and kitted out with large windows overlooking the aircraft standing. All day selection of food and with alcoholic drinks including champagne. Comfortable seating good toilet facilities overall a good business lounge and generally not as full or busy as others in Dubai.,4,0.550519389
Arthur Lim,Very impressive you can tell its almost brand new when you step in. Great large chairs to relax in. Food choices good but they should not serve items like fried fish pieces in a food warmer and have it closed - these items tend to harden up and become a real challenge for your teeth! Drinks selection for alcoholic beverages had a bartender service which you had to use which I dont really appreciate - I would prefer a self service bar but only because I'm more used to it. Noodle bar was very nice. There was also a children's play room Surau Prayer room and a massage service corner- but you had to pay for every treatment or massage available - unlike Thai AIrways BKK massage lounge which gave business class passengers a free  min massage. Would have been good if MH offered that. The bathrooms were nice but toilet amenities were not  star standard. Previously MH provided L'Occitane and Aigner toiletries but this is no longer the case. In all a great lounge - much much better than the Business class lounge at the satellite building less people which means your chances of getting to use the shower is quite high and also more peace of mind! Only  criticism - too many staff on duty - wherever you walk they follow you like as though they're keeping a look out just in case you get up to no good! I know they are only there to see if you need any service but don't overdo it. Some travellers just want some peace and space.,4,0.550519389
Robin Chen,Lounge is superb! It's far more spacious and impressive than the st/ Biz class lounges at the Satellite Building. Great warm and cold food selection good varieties at noodle bar delightful bar selection comfy business centre good natural lighting and viewing area internet stations and fully wifi lounge massage therapy facilities and best of all the bathroom! The shower and amenities are certainly  Star!,5,1.333657488
Geoff Becque,Salalah is a small regional airport with maybe  scheduled flights a day although a new terminal is under construction. The lounge is upstairs above the single departures area. It is small but comfortable and has a private ladies/family area. Limited snacks and soft drinks (no alcohol) and the toilets are adequate. Newspapers and computer terminal. Lift to descend to departures. No priority boarding it is only  yards walk to aircraft steps. The lounge is fine as an alternative to sitting in the small waiting area at departures incidentally adjacent to which there is a small smokers room.,3,-0.232618709
M Bertram,"A modern and spacious looking lounge with a good selection of food and beverages. We arrived here quite early so took advantage of the ""quiet area"" which has big comfortable chairs and large ottomans so that you can lay down and rest. It is behind a curtain though still fairly bright and can be noisy if seated near the curtain separating the area from the rest of the lounge.",4,0.550519389
D Keenan-Bokr,Business Class passengers are taken by bus to the arrivals hall. Once inside the building follow the signs for the Lounge. You pass through the Duty Free area. We were given a warm greeting upon arrival. The Lounge is quiet and has an extra area with loungers for those that may want to stretch out and have some sleep. The restaurant area offers a good variety of hot & cold meals. A mixture of Western and Arabic foods. Alcohol soft drinks and a coffee machine. You can eat here or take it into the lounge area. The staff were helpful and friendly. There is free internet access . There is a spa too which appears to be free of charge but we did not have time to make an appointment. All in all a very enjoyable experience.,5,1.333657488
D Whalley,It is a peaceful place. For much of the time the lounge has few passengers. The quality of food and drink is of a high standard. Staff are helpful. I did experience a problem in using the wi-fi but there were PCs available. The lounge is a pleasant place for a short stopover.,5,1.333657488
D Whalley,New lounge opened November . Small but has everything needed. Good selection of food. Seating good with more than sufficient seats for the passengers using the lounge. At present lounge is used only for Oman Air passengers - one flight per day. The facilities are extremely generous for this small usage. If other airlines were to use this lounge it might become too crowded but at the moment it is great.,5,1.333657488
G Becque,Large bar and restaurant with a great seating area overlooking the tarmac. Champagne spirits and decent wine available with a good selection of hot and cold food. Helpful and friendly staff a very relaxing place.,4,0.550519389
Dave Houlihan,Great Lounge huge selection of food hot and cold drinks alcoholic and non and hot drinks. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Lounge new and spotless with Wifi and a number of work stations etc. Great place to relax for a few hours.,5,1.333657488
T Devine,A pleasant surprise in sleepy Muscat. spacious lounge with ageing but comfortable sofas. Large big screen TVs free wi-fi access and a great selection of food and beverages. Unlike some Gulf airports there is a selection of alcohol. Snacks included nuts shwarma cheeses tiny sandwiches. Also a wide selection of local and regional newspapers. Only drawback is the lack of shower facilities!,3,-0.232618709
Chris Walsh,Muscat has two first/business lounges,,
Amer Chaudhry,Lounge was almost empty due to early morning. Sandwiches available along with corn flakes. Juices soft drinks tea/Coffee available on request. Computers with internet some magazines and newspapers were provided. Atmosphere quite relaxing.,3,-0.232618709
M Mejia,PR has no business class lounge in BKK and makes use of Thai's Royal Silk Lounge. The lounge has a tired feel to it with the upholstery of the furnishings worn out cracks in the walls and tiles in the toilets and rather dirty carpets. Food was edible enough with a healthy selection of drinks. In the absence of good places to hang out in BKK while waiting for a flight this lounge would do but am sure they can do better Not the best I've been in but not the worst.,3,-0.232618709
D Jones,Food very poor - not catering for western customers could only eat scrambled eggs.No croissants or other edible bread Filipino bread tends to be limited to relatively sweet rolls. No bottled mineral water only purified water from a dispenser. They seem to cater for Filipinos. Urinals in toilets were smelly.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Ginsburg,For such a lounge it's definitely substandard. What I have not found in previous comments/reviews is the washrooms (there are no showers as noted by others) which are tiny! These which are supposed to handle multiple persons are barely larger than those on the aircraft and have a total of two sit type toilets and inadequate room for those waiting or those wishing to wash hands etc. after use.,2,-1.015756808
C Hazelford,"Minimal service and a decor that could generously be described as ""dated"". Food and beverage service was also minimal and it is disappointing especially in a country so strong in the service sector.",3,-0.232618709
R Byrde,For a business class lounge Manila is definitely sub-standard. Some staff are friendly and helpful others less so. Food and beverage are average. Manila however lacks one of the basic necessities namely showers. The lounge is in urgent need of an upgrade.,3,-0.232618709
M Wood,Apart from the friendly greeting when entering this lounge there is nothing good to report. The food was very basic and not that fresh. Coffee lukewarm. Service staff indifferent. Furniture in need of an upgrade facilities basic. It would not take a huge investment to make improvement to this facility,2,-1.015756808
N Janides,"This is one of the most ""bland"" looking airline lounge that is in strong need of a major overhaul. Despite this staff were friendly and there was enough food and beverages for travellers. There are no windows and with minimal entertainment despite an occasional DVD played on the big plasma television. Philippine Airlines really need to overhaul and improve their premium services in order to remain competitive.",3,-0.232618709
David Nolsoe,Priority pass lounge used by several airlines in Calgary. Lounge is comfortable enough with a selection of refreshments. Please be aware there is no hot food -  except soup - and for this reason I give this lounge a huge fail.,2,-1.015756808
Andrew Barnes,"Used this lounge with my Priority Pass membership. The food is limited and the room itself is quite small. Shame there are no toilets in the lounge itself, which means you have to leave the lounge then re enter an explain to the staff that you have already signed in. Wouldn't recommend if you are paying for access.",1,-1.798894906
T Savage,"The Qantas international terminal business class lounge is a lazy imitation of it's counterparts. There is a lack of service generally, the bar is self service and the variety of food offerings are minimal. The lounge seems to have more in common with the lounge at the leisure destination on the Gold coast than the Qantas lounge in Singapore. Traveling with a young child, I headed for the kids corner to keep our daughter entertained as we prepared for our flight. In this case the 'corner' was very much that, distant from the lounge proper so that a responsible parent flying solo with their kids is unable to get away to the bar or food counter to get any meals without packing everything up and lugging it all with them. There was no offer from the lounge staff to watch our bags, entertain the kids briefly or to bring any food or drinks. What was available in the kids corner was adequate but a few TVs and some toys and beanbags are not especially creative or novel. These small touches make a big difference. While the lounge offers a quiet place to relax before a flight, it could be improved to bring it up to scratch and meet expectations.",5,1.333657488
N Hodgson,"Food options in the lounge were terrible, and in much need of an upgrade overall which I understand is coming. Very little natural light, and found it quite depressing. Internet was appallingly slow also. Ended up leaving and spending time in the departure. More vibrant, well lit, and much better food options!",3,-0.232618709
W Blades,"Lounge was clean, comfortable and staff were very polite and friendly. On our visit on  July  there was a high number of children in the lounge (families like ourselves travelling) which made things rather congested given the small lounge size. Unsure if this was usual given it was the end of Australian school holidays. Food was limited, but fresh and of good quality. Once again the lounge was heavily congested, so this may account for the limited availability of food. Lounge was located very close to Qantas boarding gates and only a short distance from a dedicated smoking room which makes things easy if you happen to be a smoker.",6,2.116795586
O Nyholm,"Business Lounge is very modern. Once you walk into the Qantas Club, the assistant will direct you to a non-see through door that is marked 'Business'. It also labels the access criteria. This feature makes it feel exclusive. The lounge is less than half the size of the Qantas Club, however, it serves more substantial food. It is hard to get into the lounge because you must be flying Business Class or one of Qantas', Emirates, Oneworld Platinum member. The lounge has its own business centre and mini library. It is a big step up from the a Melbourne Qantas Club",6,2.116795586
O Nyholm,"The lounge is very spacious. I don't get why there isn't a Business Lounge. The usual food choices are available, such as pastas and salads. There is a barista in the morning and from pm there is a bar. Boarding calls are made. The lounge can be busy at times because it is also used as an International lounge for Air New Zealand, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific.",6,2.116795586
James Fallon,This lounge is very old and inadequate for the volume of passengers that attempt to enter. At peak times the staff are literally forced to send eligible passengers away due to capacity constraints. Staff often get out their office desk chairs for use of the passengers due to lack of seating. All flights are morning flights so there is an adequate selection of food and drink and the staff are great! Unfortunately though they are constantly having to face the onslaught of disappointed guests who are barred from entry. Qantas have upped their flights but done nothing to sustain the surge.,3,-0.232618709
D Lobo,This lounge is totally inadequate for the number of people. Was there for the QF . Nowhere to sit comfortably people sleeping across  chairs long barista queue. As these lounges have now become one world they are beginning to resemble upmarket train waiting rooms,3,-0.232618709
D Lobo,This lounge was superb. Lots of space with different zones clean great furniture and design good bar area. Qantas/ one world airlines have spent money on this and it is world class. The only gripe is the number of showers- there are too few for the number of passengers arriving from Australia - Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane all arrive at roughly the same time to connect with the New York flight so the wait is too long. Otherwise can't fault this lounge.,5,1.333657488
D Lobo,What an awful lounge- crowded awful food and service. The food was sparse it kept running out and took ages before they replenished. No glasses available and when I told the staff she brought out  glass for me rather than refill the glass tray! There was even a queue for the toilet. Again too small for all one world customers.,2,-1.015756808
John Denholm,Qantas really has diminished the value of Club membership. While the staff were very polite and helpful this lounge (like a growing number in the Qantas group) offered little other than a clean place to sit. Hardly worth the extravagant joining and annual fees. Extremely limited offering of food - even less than you would find in a domestic club on the Australian mainland. We ended up buying food from one of the Cafes outside. I managed to get a quick look into a couple of the other Auckland lounges. Qantas should be embarrassed and ashamed of what they offer their Club members.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Davies,Arrived at Sydney airport on Good Friday morning tired and needing a place to rest refresh and have a cup of tea. It was absolute pandemonium in the lounge not a spare seat to be seen families sitting on the floor and an absolute disgrace. This is our worst business class lounge experience in  years of international travel.,1,-1.798894906
K Neilsen,Was a relief to visit this lounge after finding our connecting flight was two hours late. Staff was very good from entry to inside. A modern lounge with plenty of spaces to sit and relax. Also was very surprised to find all the reserve table signs be nice if someone explained who they were for. The food wasn't great plenty of beverages.,4,0.550519389
Craig Ritchie,Day flight to Singapore the lounge was actually pretty quiet. Food selection (breakfast) was pretty good and actually tasty. Lounge itself is really starting to look old and some of the chairs very ratty indeed. Good selection of local newspapers etc to read staff service was good. Its time to update this Business Lounge it needs a good going over which has been the case now for the past  years.,3,-0.232618709
Craig Ritchie,Compared to Hong Kong Qantas Singapore Lounge is not up to the job. Very sterile place indeed chairs look horrible and are horrible to seat in. Food selection if its Neil Perry its not up to it at all. Bar is good service is okay. Toilets and showers are good whilst there is a good selection of Australian newspapers etc to read. Overall compared to the Qantas Hong Kong Business Lounge the Singapore Lounge falls down badly indeed in terms of looks and quality offered.,3,-0.232618709
K Neilsen,It appears there is only a club lounge at Brisbane Airport and it is an utter disgrace overcrowded. We asked for the business lounge and told that was it many people had to leave as there just wasn't any room. If this is how Qantas treat their business class passengers Ill look elsewhere in future.,2,-1.015756808
R Gonzaga,"Great lounge, quiet and lots of friendly helpful staff. Good selection of food in various sections of the lounge. Good shower facilities although I had to wait for about  minutes for it to be available.",6,2.116795586
B Heil,It is ages since I have been greeted on entering a lounge with genuinely smiling faces and the offer of drinks. There is a bar serving the signature dish and a choice of good Australian wines. It's a very casual dining option if you dont want to sit at a table. The food was generally good with healthy options available and a menu to reflect time of day.,5,1.333657488
Tess Jones,Fantastic lounge probably the best we have visited. Very clean & modern staff excellent. A pleasure to visit on a long haul trip to Australia.,5,1.333657488
R King,A rather packed lounge with lots of chairs but no view of the apron or runway so boring! Freezing cold (outside was a heatwave) and when I mentioned this a member of staff said that everyone had complained - so do something about it! Several people left to warm up elsewhere. And why not? The food choice was not going to keep them entertained: there was no choice - rice and a stew. Little else in the way of food. Overall rather disappointing when you consider how good Qantas lounges can be (Singapore for example). It felt as if no one cared for the lounge.,3,-0.232618709
M Phua,"This is a beautiful lounge - huge with lots of sofas and chairs for rest between your flights. There are very few sleeper chairs around despite its size. The sleepers are found only next to the entrance to the lounge and just above the common area of the airport and near a huge billboard. So despite its intended use, it is not only noisy, you get lots of flashing lights from the nearby huge billboard. Despite having many staff around, nobody comes around to offer you drinks or to top them up. I was at one of the sofa seats downstairs and asked one of the staff if I could get orange juice. His answer  ""upstairs sir"". Not entirely incorrect but not very helpful. As compared to their lounge at Heathrow airport where the staff are not only attentive but much more helpful than these lot at Hamad airport, this lounge just doesn't cut it for me. However, food wise, they've got it covered well. From the restaurant upstairs to the sandwich bar downstairs, it is vey good. A tip for those having meals at the restaurant upstairs - there is a menu from which you can order food if you do not want to take your food from the buffet table - the staff just don't tell you about it until you ask for the menu. The lamb chop and the beef choices are excellent from this menu. The shower facilities are excellent if you can get past the heat - seems that there is no aircon in the shower rooms. Wifi connection is patchy at best. I've never been able to get a connection to view my home and office cameras in all the times that I've been there. I love Qatar Airways. I just hope that service improves at this lounge as I invariably spend a lot of time at this lounge waiting for my next flight.",6,2.116795586

N Thorpe,The Qantas Club Lounge was fairly acceptable. Very good food and drink with staff being courteous and unobtrusive. Nice showers except there was no bench or seat on which to sit down whilst putting on my shoe. The dÃ©cor deliberately industrial was not inviting or comforting. Seats were OK but not great.,4,0.550519389
B Anderson,As an Emirates platinum member I am able to access the Qantas first lounge while travelling on Emirates from New Zealand to Dubai during my stop-over in Melbourne. It is not a massively large lounge but has never been overly busy when I have visited and in fact has been very peaceful. The restaurant is excellent offering great food and quick service. The staff are brilliant without being obtrusive. I prefer this lounge to any Emirates lounge and enjoy the peace and quiet.,5,1.333657488
G David,Overcrowded dark noisy dirty full of rude passengers and overwhelmed staff. Was served scotch in a glass fresh out of the dryer so scalding hot. Was cut in queue at showers twice by pushy women with kids in tow staff helpless to enforce numbers as no one on desk. Has opened before it is ready and without adequate staff to provide service required of an international business lounge.,2,-1.015756808
Rob Bowden,"This is a new lounge at a new airport so very impressive. A good design feature is that it's right in front of you when you come through transfers so no long walks trying to find it! There's a nice check-in area with lots of lovely Qatar staff, then you go through to a nice water feature. There's a buffet restaurant with a la carte menu and bar above up a nice spiral staircase and a 'make your own' sandwich and salad bar in the opposite direction all serving alcoholic and soft drinks. There's self-service coffee machines and tea dotted around. There's a hideous smoke room for smokers, lucky I'm not. You won't need to light up, just walk in and breathe. Overall a good place to rest between flights with showers, free wifi, a nice quiet zone and I think I saw a children's play area. The duty free shops are down a long escalator below.",6,2.116795586
M Davidson,"I experienced Qatar Airways London Heathrow and Doha lounges which were fantastic in every way from the food to rest rooms. This handling lounge in Singapore was a shock, the food on offer was dry and looked like it been sitting there a long time.

S Williams,This was a sectioned off area of,2,-1.015756808
N Wallace,Qantas uses this as a shared airport lounge probably no choice. I suspect this was a oneworld shared lounge. Staff couldn't care less. The toilet had been broken into as the main door handle and lock were falling off the door. For an international lounge the food and drinks were woeful. The internet connection was difficult and rarely worked when connected just gave up on it. I wouldn't recommend it but there is no choice unless perhaps you use one of the paid lounges eg Priority Pass might be better. Seats were torn and the filling was coming out of many. At least it did have a flight status monitor. No blaring and annoying TV was a bonus. For an international shared lounge the reading material was very limited ie basically non existent.,1,-1.798894906
Rob Johnson,I know it's Sunday morning but might the staff smile and acknowledge passengers? I always thank staff for clearing tables etc. and generally get at least an acknowledgement if not a short conversation. Today - nothing. Not hugely impressed as it's far better during the week.,4,0.550519389
Trevor Young,Typically disappointing Qantas lounge. Crowded grumpy staff and passengers sprawled everywhere with luggage blocking seats. I noticed many tables had reserved signs - in all my years of travel with Qantas I was not aware that it was possible to reserve tables in the lounge. Food was generally ok but long since cooled down. Plenty of alcohol but no bottled water.,3,-0.232618709

N Brinklow,"On my outbound flight from LHR to AUH via Doha I was allowed access to the fantastic main Qatar lounge. However, on my return to LHR just  days later I was told to use a smaller lounge for oneworld frequent flyers. I was dissapointed with this change in policy, as were other passengers. The smaller frequent flyer lounge has uncomfortable seating and very poor selection of food.  Undermines the point of belonging to a frequent flier programme with lounge access. On my return to the lounge at pm I was told they had ran out of champagne and spirits apart from Bacardi. There would be no more until a store was to be opened at pm. The point of going for an indirect flight with Qatar was because I had thought I would be looked after in the lounge. It seems this is no longer the case.",2,-1.015756808
P Neville,Just visited the new Qantas club in Darwin and it was fantastic and such a huge improvement from what was there previously. The design is modern with many seating options available. The buffet was well set up and the staff were clearing by tray which looked and felt premium. I enjoyed a barista coffee then took a shower prior to my flight in a very comfortable shower room. Everything was perfect and was matched by the engaging staff to welcome me and then farewell on boarding with a bowl of mints nice touch. Great work with this new lounge Qantas.,5,1.333657488
Paul Williss,Used this lounge flying into Australia. We entered the lounge probably about . at night and there was hardly anyone in there - probably no more than thirty people. The place is huge very stark and industrial looking. As we were flying Jetstar I wisely decided to eat before the flight. Plenty of food on offer and ate from the hot buffet black pepper chicken and delicious crispy skin mashed potato. My friend had the pasta and was equally delicious all washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Went back a little later and had individual desserts the best creme brulee I have had a really good chocolate mousse and a liqueur. Staff were very pleasant a comfortable place albeit a bit cold due to air con temperature but well worth the visit.,5,1.333657488
Craig Ritchie,What a lovely lounge. Very pleasant surprise plenty of space lots of good food and drink to hand toilets and showers very clean. WIFI good as well great choice of current magazines as well as newspapers from around the world. Overall a much improved lounge in HK International. Made flying economy back to Brisbane overnight that much more pleasant.,5,1.333657488
D Fernando,As a Qatar gold member I am disappointed at the change in lounge at Doha airport back to the older previously temporary lounge. This lounge is not only too small and noisy but also crowded and uncomfortable with a poor selection of food and drinks. I have no doubt that these sentiments will be echoed by other Privilege gold members and I hope that Qatar Air reconsiders this change in order to maintain its reputation as an airline offering superior customer service.,2,-1.015756808
M Cote,Al Mourjan lounge at Hamad airport in Doha is really impressive. However missing the old Business and First Class Terminal. It is so huge and far from many gates. I prefer the LHR Qatar Airways lounge. Cozy and more quiet. The restaurant/food were amazing. Very spacious and luxury seating area. However if you are looking for a chaise longue in the quiet area be patient - there was a huge waiting list. Also they forget to install A/C in the shower rooms. So don't have a too long and hot shower because you will be sweating afterwards.,4,0.550519389
Graham Follington,Best lounge I have ever been through Heaven Class. Could not fault the place Great food and Bev staff all helpful and pleasant. There is any amount of food choice and okay WiFi. Anyone who complains about this lounge is simply impossible to please.,5,1.333657488
Craig Ritchie,This lounge needs to be revamped as its showing its considerable age. The food selection has much improved when we were taking our day flight to HK. Hot breakfast meal available which was very good along with the freshly made to order coffee. Only gripe was the Apple Mac would not work and the staff could not get it to work either. Good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read though.,4,0.550519389
A Wheatley,Very Clean good choice of drinks and food easy access to services limited operating times good to have a few drinks before the long haul to Sydney or Brisbane.,5,1.333657488
S Andrews,Outstanding we felt as if our holiday had begun at Heathrow. The quiet understated luxury was wonderful nothing was too much trouble food was amazing staff were polite and respectful. (Unlike Phuket Business Lounge where it was help yourself to a pot noodle).,5,1.333657488
B Stokes,Find negative comments about staff strange. We were waited on the whole time we were there. Most of staff were from Nepal and were very friendly. Good selection of food. We take on board about ordering sandwiches. Only real negative comment the lounge was a long way from our gate apparently km. No walk ways meant we had to rush to the gate. Perhaps you should consider having a board giving approximate walking times to the various gates.,5,1.333657488
R Yee,Used the (almost) new LAX Oneworld lounge for the first time. Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant & modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only  showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark. Here's hoping the new First lounge makes amends when finished.,3,-0.232618709
Debra Donald,I had a late PM flight with a OneWorld partner. The lounge was quite empty but it had a lovely ambience. I didn't really pay much attention to the food due to how late it was but I had a small plate of cheese and some lovely sparkling wine (and then a Jamieson as a night cap). It was extremely welcoming and lovely to be away from the disaster that is currently Brisbane International Airport with the renovation happening on L. The bathroom was spotless and the few staff around were pleasant enough.,5,1.333657488
W Meyler,The lounge is pretty spacious with plenty of seating. I arrived at : pm for a : flight so had a good couple of hours here. Bar has a very good selection with some nice red and whites. A good selection of beer both local and international. Also a good selection of spirits and liqueurs. The food on the other hand is terrible. Qantas should be ashamed to offer this level of food to business customers. You could be forgiven in thinking that you are eating a sizzler. Actually that would be better. The toilets are clean but the place has a little bit of age. If you are paying a Qantas club lounge membership then you will be disappointed. Auckland airport in general is better fitted out than the lounge.,3,-0.232618709
B Stokes,Long narrow lounge. Bar a long way from food. Easy to miss the bar Noisy. At least we got a seat. Puzzled why we are sometimes sent to different lounges. Food nothing special. Airport a nightmare.,2,-1.015756808
J Fairclough,Whilst there is a lot to be admired about this lounge it is clearly designed for business people who have  hr+ stopovers at Doha. I'm sure the a la Carte restaurants are excellent but my wife and I had less than  hr stopover and after you've made the lengthy walk from the gate had a freshen up etc the only thing we had time for is a cool beer and a selection from a quick and easy 'help yourself 'buffet (sandwich etc). The trouble is that this does not seem to exist because the food and drink section is located at the far end of the lounge and you have to put in orders for tailor made sandwiches. We did not have the time for that so downed a beer and left. Surely it would be possible to put a small selection of buffet sandwiches nachos crisps nuts etc for people who were in our position ? The lounge gets very busy around pm to  am and it was pretty difficult to find two seats together during that time though when we left it was a lot less crowded.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,Wasn't expecting much. No natural light but there was a decent selection of hot and cold food. I just had some fresh fruit cake and water. All very pleasant. I was called to the gate  minutes before departure this was too early as I was just hanging about the gate which was too hot and had awful Mosquitos flying about.,4,0.550519389
Jim Ash,Qantas' International First Class Lounge/Sydney Airport is one of the most best lounges i have experienced aside from Cathay's Hong Kong First Lounge. The separate dining area is amazing with many options and the personal attention is wonderful. Even later as I was there for a few hours prior to flying to Dallas I had some items from the self-service area which to me was quite an assortment of snacks to small meal-like offerings and beverages galore. Separate areas for computer use relaxing the library and of course views of the planes with floor to ceiling windows create private yet open feel.,5,1.333657488
Ronald Binding,I was looking forward to this lounge as it was the first time in Singapore. I thought I was walking into a cafeteria all hard surfaces and noisy. The seating area was not that comfortable low hard chairs with low tables. The shower and toilets were ok but I was travelling with a friend who had been there before the renovations and said that these had not been touched. Another thing is the dress code (or lack of it) - some travel as if they are going to the beach. I'm talking of singlets shorts and throngs can't they buy a $ t-shirt at least and a pair of joggers. Come on Qantas lift your game.,3,-0.232618709
G Mossom,An absolute gem of a lounge. Sit at the bar or relax in a comfy seat & enjoy the waited service the choice is yours. There's a choice of informal dining from the Deli or eat in the Brasserie - I chose the fillet steak with peppercorn sauce. When the food & drink takes its toll the 'facilities' are of quality hotel standard. All lounges should use this place as their blueprint,,
Alan Wan,On arrival the lounge looks spectacular. But it is too big and loses its exclusive feel. There are some comfortable leather sofas but too many of the seats are uncomfortable. There are two restaurants serving good buffet food which is of good quality but the Heathrow Qatar lounge has a superior offering with cook to order dishes. As Qatar Airways treats this airport as a hub with potentially long transit periods then a few more facilities should ideally be provided such as a spa and lounger type seating allowing you to have a more comfortable sleep. After paying good money for a business class flight I don't feel I should have to pay good money for a transit hotel. As M Clarke mentioned in the review below  there are loads of staff who hang about doing not a lot I don't want to be fussed over but it would be nice to be offered a drink or something. Overall a good lounge but underwhelming maybe I was spoilt at the Qatar Heathrow lounge but I think this lounge could do better given all the hype on their website.,4,0.550519389
Alan Wan,A fantastic lounge the best I have visited and in my opinion better than the Al Mourjan lounge at Doha which I visited on my arrival. The restaurant was amazing with made to order dishes and superb dessert station - I don't have a sweet tooth but just couldn't resist. Very spacious and luxury seating area with staff taking your drinks orders. A minor and amusing point was the waiter (who claimed he was the barman) had never heard of port I explained it was similar to sherry but he was still unsure what I was on about (he sounded eastern European) in the end I settled for another glass of Bollinger champagne.,5,1.333657488
Marian Clarke,Used this lounge as an Emirates customer. Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from  slices of cheese on  plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help! No announcements in English - fine for me but not so great for those who don't speak either Arabic or rapid French. Really poor!,3,-0.232618709
S Bingham,A very large space with lots of seating and a smoking area at one end of the lounge. Two bars but with nothing on display and no staff to serve. Food appeared after sometime but was inedible sandwiches dried out and who knows what was inside.,1,-1.798894906
Irene Dymond,Very poor variety of food and drinks available. Cheeses were tasteless and bread rolls did not taste fresh. If you want something tasty eat before you get to this lounge. Very very quiet which some will see as a bonus.,3,-0.232618709
D Goldspring,New Qantas lounge in Terminal . Excellent facilities including spacious and clean showers bar with beer on tap adequate selection of wines and spirits and a barman to serve you. Extensive selection of hot and cold food including a choice of  dishes made to order and served to you in the dining area.,5,1.333657488
C Hamilton,Overcrowded great barista coffee and accompanying muffins avoid the basic boring usual items and wait for the good stuff on the plane. Breakfast is the usual fair chipolata sausages cold hash browns soggy tomatoes. Lunch is usually soup and a selection of rolls. The food in here doesn't match the decor even if it is hard to find a seat! Friendly staff make up for the lack of choice in food and beverages are pretty good.,3,-0.232618709
M Clarke,First things first - to go to the loo when you arrive (not an uncommon destination I think) you have to go up a long ramp and then down another long ramp diagonally opposite then double back on yourself and walk another / feet,,
C Moreira,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company dealing with distinction its premium passengers. The lounge for business class is the best I have met in the world. Must impeccable service Krug and all the delicacies of the company's staff of care. Are to be congratulated.,5,1.333657488
C Moreira,Qatar Airways is a spectacular company however this Sao Paulo Airport executive class lounge used by the company is awful. All companies of the OneWorld use this lounge in the new T  in GRU. The catering is horrible the drinks have few options and low quality.,2,-1.015756808
P Taylor,I guess if you come from Sydney or Melbourne you are spoilt by the QF first class lounges which are amongst the best anywhere particularly on the catering front and I also guess you shouldn't expect anything special airline wise in the US but really the all in one world first class lounge in Lax is pretty ordinary. Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,3,-0.232618709
C Oates,Spacious uncrowded. Great food options including two made-to-order signature dishes reflecting the best of local cuisine styles in a lively eating area. Try a Singapore Sling - the equal of Raffles Long Bar version. Quieter lounge zone available for relaxing or laptop use. Fast Wi-Fi. Customer service service outstanding.,5,1.333657488
J Freeman-Duffy,Qantas International Business Lounge in Sydney. Lounge was very spacious very clean and staff very attentive with service and cleaning of the lounge. Lounge wasn't very busy which was a surprise. Food on offer was okay not great some more offerings would be good Beverages on the other hand were great. They had my beer on tap (Fat Yak). Overall pleasant experience and good relaxation before any long haul flight.,4,0.550519389
Stefan Gueck,At present probably the best lounge in the world matches and exceeds other first class lounges. Modern extremely spacious food and drink selection simply amazing. Modern architecture all perfectly organized.,5,1.333657488
D Clark,Had a long layover here. Lounge is super impressive as far as the aesthetics go and the range of different seating options is good. The food was of a good standard: I ate upstairs and went for the mezze option rather than the a la carte. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I wanted somewhere to sleep and was lucky enough to get one of the quiet area cells. Not very comfortable but I was able to get a few hours sleep and a shower before the next leg of my flight. Overall a really good experience: felt much less busy and cluttered that the equivalent in Dubai.,5,1.333657488
Anders Pedersen,I was disappointed and alienated by the huge lounge sections which lack any cosy atmosphere and personality. Facilities are there but not always easy to find or access. A desert of steel glass and marble. It is far too big.,4,0.550519389
Alan Pedley,For years this lounge has shared what must be a k dial-up Internet connection. For business travellers hoping for last minute skype e-mail etc before the -hr flight back to oz forget it. Better staying in AA T and catching a late shuttle to Tom Bradley. It is consistently ( times per year since this new lounge format opened) so bad I cannot begin to describe.,2,-1.015756808
J Jones,The lounge was great a friendly engaging welcome on arrival from the team at the desk. The lounge was very clean and tidy well stocked with newspapers and magazines. The buffet was well presented and I noticed the staff replenishing and tidying the food spills. Barista coffee was superb and the young lady serving had a keen interest in her customers. A great experience in a comfortable lounge which reminded me why reminded me why I fly Qantas.,5,1.333657488
R Wilkinson,Was surprised how crowded the lounge was. Had trouble finding a seat. Good selection of food and drink and a pleasant view onto tarmac. Seating comfortable.,4,0.550519389
William Tacon,The business class lounge is horrible for more than - hours. A  hour layover is an ordeal given the absence of facilities for lying down to sleep. If you find the quiet area tucked away just off the main dining area there are no loungers or blankets or pillows - but I was offered pyjamas! The room reverberates - too much stone metal and wood. The facilities are spotless and staff very polite and helpful.,3,-0.232618709
John Pierson,This has to be one of the most dramatic interior spaces at any airport anywhere. The size of at least several football fields with several levels it is both restful and convenient. While we sampled just a bit of the food the mezze and the rest looked wonderful. We were there mid- morning and the space seemed almost empty. Staff were terrific helpful and informative.,5,1.333657488
Thomas Johnston,I was in transit for almost  hours so delighted that the lounge is now fully operational. As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water. I'd just finished changing the phone and reading the printed copies of the UK newspapers when staff told me that breakfast was being served in the upstairs restaurant. All the staff were helpful and friendly.,5,1.333657488
A McNicol,Qantas have now rescheduled most Asian flights for mid morning departures. Also departing at this time are flights to all New Zealand airports and South Africa!! Plus don't forget all the One-World and other carriers that also use this Lounge. You do not need to be a genius to work out that this means massive over-crowding in one small time slot. Yet another diminution of the Qantas brand. A previously really good lounge with great food services and staff but never designed for the traffic in this time slot.,3,-0.232618709
T Collier,Unlike the scrum of the Qantas club through the door the business lounge at Melbourne seemed very sedate. We arrived at that time in-between breakfast finishing but being too early for lunch so there weren't too much food options available for us. The lattes were expertly made I have to say but would have been nice to have had some sort of biscuit/cake to go with them. Soft drinks were via a soda dispenser but the glasses are tiny - more designed for adding a mixer to alcohol than for someone wanting just a pure glass of Sprite. Plenty of magazines/newspapers to read or you can watch the world go by looking out the big windows that overlook the gates. Free and unlimited wifi was available in the lounge.,4,0.550519389
B Rippingale,Had a  hour visit to this lounge courtesy of Air New Zealand. Lots of seating with armchairs sofas and dining areas. Several TV screens with  large surrounded by comfy seating. Several shower/toilets well maintained and clean although unsure if how to get a towel if you needed a shower. There was a selection of drinks including spirits soft drinks and coffee/Tea. Overall there was a nice feeling to the lounge light roomy and welcoming. Unfortunately food was lacking in choice cold selection was ok salad cold meat and cheese. As for the hot food there was curry and nothing else. No choice and no rice to accompany the dish. This must be the worst business lounge for hot food choice anywhere. As for dessert there was a choice of chocolate brownies and lollies. Once again very disappointing. This would definitely put me off using Qantas Business class especially as this was the international Lounge. Overall good if you want to have a drink and relax but Don't go in to eat.,4,0.550519389
Frances Jojart,The lounge is a great place to stay to pass the time between flights. The lounge offers wonderful food plentiful drinks and the wonderful showers.,5,1.333657488
Patrick Murphy,This lounge is very spacious and comfortable there are many areas and dining options. The staff are very helpful. But there is a problem with the lack of toilet facilities first time I've seen a queue for the gents. In general very good but I still prefer the old premium terminal.,4,0.550519389
W Avery,The lounge didn't feel exclusive and too overcrowded. Lounge open to noise of the rest of the terminal and very difficult to find. Had breakfast and food offering was extremely bland. I expected so much and was very disappointed. Compared to the Premium Lounge at LHR this is a joke.,3,-0.232618709
J Moore,A zoo. Used the lounge on  July - en route to Singapore. The place was packed to the rafters and seating difficult to find tables a mess of post breakfast debris and the decor is really showing its age - especially if you compare it with the First Class lounge next door. Australians are great lounge users through the QF Club membership scheme consequently international BC lounges are heavily used by economy travelling but club member passengers. Domestically Qantas has come to realise that Business class paying passengers deserve their dedicated lounges away from the scrum of the club it's now time Qantas realised that international customers paying a hefty premium to stay loyal to Qantas.,3,-0.232618709
A Kenny,Visited early May and was surprised by the experience after reading some bad reviews for LAX. I assume this was the new lounge in the Tom Bradley terminal. There were  large screen TV's with NBA MLB and NHL being televised. Bar service great with loads of choice as well as a self service area. More than enough space before our flight to Sydney at .pm in the evening with a number of laptops available. Food selection not quite as good as Emirates Lounges but still adequate. Definitely recommend.,5,1.333657488
J Sanderson,Poor air conditioning lack of food choices terrible internet (spent  minutes trying to download  emails and never actually managed it). Even the on-table tablets couldn't connect to the internet. Very poor in comparison to the old premium lounge.,1,-1.798894906
M Baughman,Qatar Airways new business class lounge is up and running and is quite exceptional. A simpler more elegant version of Emirates lounge in Dubai. I was there when it was not very crowded so it will be interesting to see what it's like when it is full - that was the worst part of the old premium lounge. The lounge has  dining facilities several snack areas and bars lots of seating a business area and as with its old premium lounge a lot of staff being helpful. Big and airy it is open to the new terminal but the noise did not seem to be a problem. There are numerous zones for seating broken up by architectural screen walls interior plantscaping and changes to the floor level. Most seats have a touchpad for announcements and surfing and a small set up of bottled water and simple snacks. Aesthetically the design is flawless.,5,1.333657488
C Andersson,Expected more from the temporary lounge it is not close to the standards of the lounge at the old airport. Only - tables for eating the rest are small narrow tables with two electric outlets placed between two armchairs not enough room for two to place plates.,3,-0.232618709
G Satchell,I fly in and out of Singapore on business frequently and naturally I was keen to visit the newly renovated Qantas lounge. Whoever designed this lounge has obviously never had to do business in an airport lounge. It has been transformed into a noisy cafeteria styled open lounge. The hard surfaces (walls and floor) create a vast noisy cavern with no consideration for acoustics. Qantas has completely overlooked the business class traveller here. There are no work stations or desk areas and if you need to print anything you have to go to the check in desk to collect your private and personal documents. I'm standing at a chest height bar trying to use the laptop as every table is full. If I sit down my hands are at shoulder height trying to type. Despite a good bar and what looks to be a good food selection this lounge is no better than the basic Qantas Club lounge in Sydney or Melbourne.,3,-0.232618709
Robert Grave,Although the first class lounge has been in operation or a few years now and the standard of service in the restaurant is first class (run by Sofitel) the amenities provided (moisturiser razors etc.) have all but disappeared. There wasn't even a toothbrush to be had and I had to go to the desk to ask for one. Considering what one pays for business and first class with Qantas compared to some other airlines I would have expected better.,4,0.550519389
Chee Beng Ter,Got a complimentary Qantas Club pass from my partner to use on my trip SYD-SIN-SYD last month. Decided not to use it on the lounge in Sydney Int'l Airport as it is always crowded but on Singapore Lounge. My choice proved me right the new lounge is great there are more seats inside the lounge with power supply and USB charging. Staff fabulous and tables are cleaned when guests left. Bars well stock and the buffets and menu are good.,5,1.333657488
C Lywahoi,The temporary lounge is a real shame compared to the previous one : overcrowded poor choice of food and drinks. Terrible when you have many hours of transit in the middle of the night. No wifi dedicated to the lounge but Airport free wifi very slow.,2,-1.015756808
I Smith,Business class lounge was full with no where to seat. Very limited food.. Refused entry to the Oryx even though there own website states I should have been allow in.,2,-1.015756808
M Coombs,The business class lounges at the new airport in Doha are sill under construction and won't be open for another  months a fact you will only find out at checking as we did. There is a temporary first and business class lounge but access is highly restricted due to their limited space and normal oneworld status privileges don't apply. The temporary first class lounge is cramped hot offers a coffee machine with a few snacks. If you are going to be in transit for any length of time recommend you avoid the temporary lounges and head to the transit hotel instead or stay in the main concourse where it's cooler and less congested. I am very surprised that they didn't put the building of their new premium lounges as a priority prior to the new airport opening.,2,-1.015756808
T Kinder,Sydney International Business lounge is spacious with a modern decor. Around : once the lunchtime flights to LAX and Singapore depart it's quiet. The informal 'island dining' was pleasant and there were additional food buffets - including a very tasty Fijian style goat curry. The gelato bar was a nice touch - only  varieties but a nice after meal palette cleanser. There are ample Australian wines (no Champagne) top shelf spirits (but no malt whisky) international and Australian beers and soft drinks. A barista is present to make coffees. The staff were extremely pleasant - perhaps because of the early afternoon lull they had more time to interact with the few passengers waiting for the late afternoon flight to Dubai/LHR and were happy to have a chat. The vista is nothing special - though you can watch plane movements across the apron if that's your thing. Altogether a pleasant and enjoyable experience and a nice way to start a holiday.,4,0.550519389
S Barnetson,Had Use of this lounge on the way to Frankfurt via Ho Chi Min City as Vietnam Air and Qantas codeshare on this leg of the Trip. It may need a bit of an update with furnishings but the staff and food are way above most other lounges. The most impressive thing in this lounge is the showers and the selection of drinks both Alcoholic and non. People who complain should visit the Star Alliance lounge in Frankfurt or one of the lounges at Gatwick.,5,1.333657488
Eric Daniels,Excellent new lounge for Qantas at Singapore. High quality service with skilled and welcoming staff. Very good range of food and drinks catering to all tastes. Personalised level of service unique to usual lounge experience.,5,1.333657488
J Howsam,Cost for the Oryx lounge is USD. Given the state of Doha airport whilst the new one is being constructed I think it well worth the money. Showers alone after a long haul are worthwhile and the buffet whilst simple is plentiful and the coffee good. Spacious clean and plenty of seating.,4,0.550519389
T Cheung,The Premium is huge but there are often too many passengers using it. Staff are very courteous and tried very hard and found tables for us in minutes. Lots of choices in buffet food and drinks. However quality on soup and hot dishes are so-so. Arabian snacks are impeccable and are worthy to try. Lots of bar stands for bar services. Bathrooms are spotless as staff will clean all stations before another passenger will use the toilet. The game room was closed and no one was there. The playroom lacks facility and was not attended. There is a Duty Free just for premium customers but there are not many exciting goods there. Generally cannot fault the Premium Terminal. There probably is not a better lounge than QR's Terminal. However they have raised the expectation too high that it is hard to meet the expectation. Hopefully they will have a larger Premium Terminal when new airport opens as they need a terminal that is at least  times larger than this one to make it a comfy lounge and allow them to continue to expand.,4,0.550519389
M McCullough,Check in staff were no help in locating airside lounge. Shared with other carriers it was comfortable but offered poor selection of food and beverages. Bright with airfield view.,3,-0.232618709
C Everett,A pleasant enough place to take a break for an hour or so and I was flying on a very cheap business class fare so was reasonably happy but if I had been paying full price I think I would have expected more from this lounge. Very small space with limited food choices but what was there was pleasant enough. Instructions on how to use the coffee machine would have been helpful.,3,-0.232618709
S Waterfall,A very good business class lounge. The food was excellent and the hot showers that my wife and I had was great and very refreshing. WiFi was great and the staff were more than willing to help.,5,1.333657488
M Wallner,Compared to the excellent Business Lounge the First Class Lounge does not offer any additional value. It's smaller and at certain times quite full. I would recommend the Business Lounge next to it if it's too full in the First Lounge.,3,-0.232618709
W Anstey,"The new lounge in hadn't opened on our way thru to HKT on th April but had by the time we came back on th April. What a disappointment! Being Platinum I was led to believe it was like the brilliant First class lounge in Sydney. Not so. How about no computers or showers! How about sitting cafeteria style with bowls of buns in spots along the table where you would have to request another diner to ""pass the bread please"". It really is just so average. We had to go back to the BA lounge to use a computer. I thought it was a First class lounge but it is open to everyone from Qantas Club to Business class and everyone in between by the look of it. On the other hand the staff were fantastic and will obviously enjoy working in their new environment.",3,-0.232618709
J Straga,The lounge hot menu is Chinese. I am confused as to why Qantas feed their Australian business only Asian food. The only other things we could eat were Thai spring rolls with no taste. The drinks were nice and so was the fresh fruit. One Asian option is OK but everything?,3,-0.232618709
Anders Pedersen,Qatar Airways uses in Milano (Malpensa) the Sala Montale lounge (B-pier non-Schengen) for their premium frequent flyers and business class passengers. The lounge is marvelous. Its new interesting design gorgeous view of the airport aircraftsâ€™ trafficking just outside the huge panorama windows overlooking starts and landings and a handful of international gates. The lounge is very clean. Furniture composition and art provide an elegant mixture of privacy and plenum options for travelers. On the minus is a stunning lack of hot dishes the only hot dish available is instant noodles. Snacks are many and drinks are even more inclusive of Italian champagne (spumante). Fruits and juices are plenty and coffee machines likewise. Italian cheeses salamis minipizzaâ€™s etc. could also have been a nice addition. Toilets lack shower but are well designed. WiFi is a bit tricky to connect to but works well once connected.,4,0.550519389
C Johnson,LHR lounge deserves the rave reviews. Excellent restaurant quality food and service with a knockout wine list. Lunch of crayfish washed down with a premier cru bourgogne! Absolutely no skimping on anything and everything works. Delightful staff with a sense of humour. Faultless. We felt vaguely guilty about such luxury! Doha premium terminal was busier but not far behind in quality. We had no trouble finding quiet seating on both visits. Both lounges are better than any others we have used in the last decade. The bus transfers to and from aircraft are a minor issue and actually interesting,,
David Law,Outstanding ambience service food and wine. The staff were very attentive and polite and absolutely charming.,5,1.333657488
S Ross,This lounge takes you back to the 's. Although it's clean and tidy it's certainly not up to world standard. Some of the lounge chairs were very uncomfortable.,3,-0.232618709
A McNicol,Nice new lounge with enough seating for all at peak morning period. The staff were great with a level of service lacking in the bigger Qantas lounges. Food the same as everywhere else adequate but some variety would be appreciated.,4,0.550519389
M Huntly,Had the opportunity to use the newly opened Qantas lounge at Changi on the th of April and cant say that I was overly impressed at all. Cold uninviting and lacked any atmosphere at all. The staff however are wonderful and made up for what the lounge itself lacked. Am wondering who may have designed the space and secondly who approved it I expected Qantas to come up with a lot better.,4,0.550519389
Craig Ritchie,A very small but very clean lounge. Packed out as we awaited our flight back to Sydney at am from Honolulu. Service excellent food selection okay drink selection ditto. Toilets very clean. Only downside is the lounges wifi and business pc's both as slow as a wet week badly in need of upgrading particularly the  PC's. Good selection of Australian magazines and newspapers.,4,0.550519389
A Wood,First visit arrived from Hong Kong  : huge airy lounge relatively low crowd plenty of lounge chairs & tables available. Hot buffet meals in restaurant area looked ok but I didn't sample. Food/bakery in lounge area had a small selection including breads cheeses yoghurts olives meat slices etc. Disappointed a true cappuccino wasn't available no decaf tea or coffee. Toilets staffed with several cleaners was very good. I enjoyed a refreshing shower. Second visit very busy took a little time to find a table. WiFi worked well. Toilets busy very clean as cleaner checked briefly after each person. Small dessert slices quite nice. Much more variety and quantity in lounge bakery - excellent. Still no cappuccino nor decaf available from bar. Overall an impressive lounge in layout and style but no decaf tea or coffee.,5,1.333657488
G Mossom,A tale of  halves. Arrived outbound around midnight the lounge was packed and had to ask a member of staff to help in locating a couple of seats (which they did within  mins). The facility is good but is overwhelmed by sheer numbers turning it into a below average experience. Departed flustered and irritated. Inbound arrived around midday and what a different experience. Lots of space with about % of seats occupied. Tried the restaurant which had both buffet and a la carte available - good food and good wine made for an excellent lunch. Shower facilities clean and pleasant with lots of amenities available. Try and pick your transit time! Scores reflect an average of the  experiences.,4,0.550519389
V Edwards,Traveled through LHR-DOH-BKK and the same return. Outbound the lounge was very crowded with seats with two together hard to find. Disappointed with the lack of assistance from staff. This lounge is not a patch on its equivalent in LHR. Not a calm relaxing environment for a transfer.,3,-0.232618709
Craig Ritchie,I found this lounge quite pleasant. PCs etc were quite slow but food service was excellent. Its a very small lounge so its not hard to have it quite full but we found quiet seats where the PCs were. Toilets immaculate lounge very clean staff great food good given we had a am flight to Sydney. Lounge could do with updating but given that Qantas don't have many flights out of Honolulu its suitable for the passengers.,4,0.550519389
A Donnellan,Lounge is very dated and showing its age with drab colour scheme and tired furnishings. However they have an excellent selection of food and wines. No French fizz but the Sallinger sparkling is very good. Highlight of my visit was the gelato bar. The staff at the desk and in the lounge were friendly. The wifi has finally been fixed.,5,1.333657488
C Ritchie,Lounge absolutely packed out this particular Wednesday morning. Food just average like a domestic Q Club breakfast so left the eating to that on the aircraft which was for a change far superior. Barista available for coffee which was good. Used PC whilst in lounge also a good selection of current magazines and newspapers to read. Toilets were very clean.,4,0.550519389
A Silcock,Friendly staff who provided a service second to none. Choice of Krug or Bollinger Rose champagnes went down very well. Seafood platter was great with lobster and King prawns provided by in house chef Spent an extremely pleasant interlude prior to boarding after check in and official formalities Looking forward to next visit.,5,1.333657488
Alfred Vachris,Pleasant oasis for an extended layover. It was a little crowded at times with peak departures.,5,1.333657488
M Shah,A very impressive lounge. It is massive with loads of seating areas. There are dining areas lounging areas and snoozing areas. Selection of food and beverages is very good. Wide variety fresh and tasty. There is no reading material but WiFi is fast and free. The only let down is the bathroom facilities.  showers for several hundred passengers does not work very well.,5,1.333657488
C Ritchie,Adelaide Terminal is a MASSIVE improvement from the old one that I last flew into. The Qantas Club near Gate  is pretty much brand new very spacious very clean and well laid out. A lot of people were using it the food selection was very good the service by staff excellent and the toilets were outstanding. Very very pleasant indeed wish this were the case in the Qantas Club lounges in Sydney and Brisbane (they need updating badly). The only issue we had is that if your flight is in Gates below  then you have a significant walk to make the relevant gate so make allowance for this.,5,1.333657488
Mark McCutcheon,Qantas has got it right when it comes to bringing kids into their lounges. In contrast with BA's policy of counting young children as guests Qantas takes a different position allowing a member to bring in one guest and their children.,4,0.550519389
R van Niekerk,I found this lounge overcrowded hot dirty and a little run down. Bathrooms were dirty with some stalls inoperative. Staff were unfriendly and even sarcastic at times. This experience ruined my opinion of Qantas and my preference for flying with them.,2,-1.015756808
G Mossom,A joy - understated and elegant throughout and more like a hotel than a lounge. Though not the biggest there are areas for relaxing a cocktail bar a deli with bistro style dining area and a more formal brasserie. Attentive staff and the chicken satay I tried while sitting at the bar hit the spot.,4,0.550519389
Francis Boylin,My wife and I had the experience of this lounge going to and from the Far East last month. Once you get to the Premium Terminal it is great. The only problem is until the new terminal is ready you have to ride around the airport for what seems an eternity on a bus. The lounge on the other hand was a welcome respite from all this. The personnel are friendly and extremely helpful. We found the same level of service both times we were there and each visit was about  hours different than the other. Plenty of seating great Wi-Fi fresh food and good drinks were all there in abundance. Qatar is a great airline and there Business Class lounge was a wonderful part of the total experience.,5,1.333657488
M Bertram,This lounge is the only one in Male airport and it's ok but not great. The food looked as though it had been sitting around for ages and they had the air conditioner turned up a bit too high so it was very cold in the lounge. On the plus side they have nice comfortable seats clean bathrooms and a selection of magazines and newspapers to read. Certainly pales in comparison to the Premium Terminal in Doha.,3,-0.232618709
Peter Greich,Dreadful lounge at Honolulu airport. Far removed from the immigration check points. Food selection really poor. As explained by staff the only hot selection was toast. Lounge is cramped and dated. The male staff member was outstanding in ensuring that passengers were attended too.,2,-1.015756808
R Turner,The Qantas Club at Hobart Airport is now inside security thanks to a new corridor but is still by far the smallest of the capital city airports. On my last trip to Sydney I visited the lounge and there was just one seat left. Due to the limited space the chairs are also squashed much closer than other Qantas lounges. On a positive note the lounge offers good views of the runway and parked aircraft.,4,0.550519389
K Hirst,Quite basic and dark decor very dated. Food uninspiring and basic but then it was a very late night departure (nearly midnight) so maybe the options were better earlier in the evening. Lots of monitors to ensure you don't miss your flights. The bathrooms were not great. Overall pretty average.,2,-1.015756808
S Strong,This lounge was an absolute delight. It was immaculate bright comfortable and modern. The staff were attentive and the food was of a high quality. It was not busy when we were there and maybe this enhanced our experience and also of course it is brand new. We were travelling on holiday and this was a wonderful start to our first business class experience. The service on the plane kept up the -star service. We did a brief stop on our return at the Doha lounge and it was a disappointment after the hype we'd read nowhere near our Heathrow experience.,4,0.550519389
S Strong,Had a half-hour to spend in this lounge whilst journeying from Melbourne to London Heathrow. The staff look wonderful with the females in the maroon Qatar livery and the men in their sharp suits. The lounge looks impressive too. However when you cannot even find a vacant seat and a request to a member of staff for help is responded to with a dismissive wave of the arm. It is evident that they cannot cope with volume and the purpose of the patrolling staff is rather lost on me. I found it quite ironic that Qatar promotes this lounge as being superb yet for me it was the major disappointment in an otherwise excellent Qatar Airways experience.,2,-1.015756808
Tom Johnston,On the outward flight to Bangkok only a short transit time but coming back over  hours in Doha and there is no finer place to spend such a long transit time. The business class lounge was quite busy when I arrived so I thought Iâ€™ll find a seat visit the restaurant when the crowds were less - big mistake as I fell asleep and by the time I awoke theyâ€™d finished serving meals. Although you could get drinks I missed a very nice looking mutton dish. The lounge was almost empty during the night and only began to fill up again early the following morning when more flights stared to arrive. The service from the staff was wonderful - somebody walking around checking you were okay. Iâ€™d only been awake a few minutes before a young lady arrived with a blanket. Qatar use the Escape Lounge at Manchester and one of the Thai lounges in Bangkok but nothing can compare to the premium terminal in Doha.,5,1.333657488
Craig Ritchie,Quite a nice lounge with a good choice of food and drink available. Wifi available must ask reception for the password. Very clean showers and toilets. Staff service very good. Good selection of Australian newspapers/magazines available. Very close to the Qantas boarding gates in the G Concourse of Bangkok International.,5,1.333657488
Annalisa Greene,Large and clean lounge. Excellent food and beverage selection. Clean and tidy showers and bathroom facilities. Overlooks the airport so you can look out the widow and see planes! Staff were pleasant on checking in however the staff working in the lounge didn't really engage in chat or smile as you passed by. They were just concentrating on doing whatever they were doing. A fabulous calm place to wait instead of with the screaming masses of kids and excited travellers.,5,1.333657488
Kim Thomsen,As always a pleasant experience to go to the new Qatar Airways Lounge in Terminal . I tried the sit down dinner service the food was tasty and plentiful and the service great.,5,1.333657488
D Lublin,Very fine lounge. Good food. As others mentioned no alcohol is available during Ramadan which seems unfortunate if inevitable. Very comfortable and soothing space - flight announcements aren't made but plenty of screens showing times and staff will also notify you. Showers along with razors and toothbrush are available in the bathroom. The one real shame is that there are not really any spaces to lie down and most people are traveling after pretty long haul flights often at odd hours. But none of this detracts from the excellence of the lounge. A real highlight is the quality of the service. Staff are excellent and seemingly eager to help - the contrast with say United Airlines could not have been more stark. The check-in to both the lounge and the airline is made as simple as possible. A real plus when flying Qatar Airways.,5,1.333657488
M Coleman,During Ramadan it is totally empty no alcohol is served at all. Other standards are excellent but not everyone who travels with Qatar Airways is Islamic.,4,0.550519389
G James,Excellent lounge - very warm atmosphere. The showers were spotless. The food was excellent and there was a very good range of both cold and hot food available even at the late hour of  p.m. Lovely Minestrone soup - piping hot. A very relaxing place - wish all lounges were this nice.,4,0.550519389
S Moolchandaney,Very well lit spacious areas and ample comfortable seating. Wide choice of beverages and snacks. The Restaurant Dining looked good ( though did not try ). Same for the Spa. Nice working areas with sufficient iMacs. In the early morning busy hour the lounge still had enough seating. Courteous staff.,5,1.333657488
Craig Ritchie,A quiet Business lounge located at the Brisbane International whilst waiting for our Hong Kong flight. Lounge is comfortable plenty of seating good coffee available selection of food is not so good very ordinary in fact could do with a revamp. Alcohol available even with a mid morning flight out. Good selection of local papers and magazines available to read as well as free wifi and internet. Overall a serviceable international business class lounge that could do with some fine tuning that would make it a wonderful start to one's departure.,4,0.550519389
L Hooper,Well appointed large area courteous staff but a few more signs would help. Travelling during Ramadan is a problem if your stopover is for any length of time and you're used to an evening drink. As alcohol was served on both legs of the flight we were surprised that it was not available under any circumstances in the lounge - we would have been happy to have been quarantined into non-Muslim section of the lounge or similar - to while away the time between  and  pm. I'm always happy to respect other cultures but it was the confusing messages that got to me and the lack of information about their services when booking.,4,0.550519389
K Thomsen,Fantastic new lounge at LHR. Arrived from an  o'clock flight and promptly served breakfast from the buffet. The cook showed great knowledge of the food and ingredients served and staff responded promptly to requests. Seating area was spacious with choice of window seating central relaxing area with water fountain or TV corner. Very pro-active staff tending to customers needs through out the stay.,5,1.333657488
Martin Brown,By presenting my One World Sapphire card I was given access to this lounge and the staff on reception very friendly. The lounge was too small for the amount of people present. At either end of the lounge were televisions although it was very difficult to hear them over the noise of the people. The smoking section wasn't screened off and I could hear people complaining about the smoke in the non smoking areas. Drink in plentiful supply including alcoholic juices tea etc and snacks were available although these were mainly cakes dates etc. It was surprising that even though there were so many people the lounge was tidy and plates and cups were cleared often. The staff clearing the plates were friendly but the staff behind the bar area didn't seem as friendly but they certainly weren't rude. It was certainly a retreat from the main terminal and as you get refreshments for 'free' to be honest even though it was very full I cannot complain and I did enjoy being there.,3,-0.232618709
M McGowan,It is an okay lounge. Has very slow internet but awesome catering. It offers drinks and snacks and overall it is impressive. It can get very busy though right before the flights to Australia.,4,0.550519389
R Pearce,Food generally of good quality. Food choices not always great (I might be a bit picky) - usually worse when changing over from breakfast to lunch etc. Drink choice excellent. Even when it's busy there's always somewhere to sit. Good view of planes and the city. Computers are great and wifi readily available. One of the selling points when travelling Qantas.,5,1.333657488
David Beggs,Pleasant greeting and offered lunch on entering lounge. Very clean and comfortable with frequent offers of snacks - which were delicious. Bathrooms very well appointed and clean. Called for flight at the right time with staff lining up to say goodbye. A thoroughly pleasant experience in a comfortable and well run Lounge.,5,1.333657488
M Bertram,On arrival into Doha the lounge was jam packed (about am) though we did manage to find a seat. Nonetheless the food and drinks were tasty and in plentiful supply. The bathrooms were clean and virtually empty. On our return journey (about pm) the lounge was much less busy and so we were able to spread out a bit more. It's a nice place to while away an hour or two.,5,1.333657488
Andrew Nethercott,The lounge is in line with being a -Star airline. Good food good drink selection comfy polite friendly staff.. I would route through Doha anytime.,5,1.333657488
Corinne Prevost,Super lounge with maximum comfort. The staff is very attentive to your needs. The only small critique would be that the duty free area is somewhat reduced for products.,5,1.333657488
J Kearney,The entry is calming and refreshing spaciousness captivating. A La Carte dining sublime for my wife and me the best was the PAYOT Spa. There really is only one problem with this lounge. It has set the standard so high other lounges we experienced were poor in comparison.,5,1.333657488
Puzio Anna,No wonder no one uses the facility as there is nothing here - almost nothing to eat poor selection of drinks no restaurants. Qantas you are not the first class airline.,3,-0.232618709
Willy Fischer,Qatar Airways Business class passengers or Privilege Club gold Members may use the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge at Frankfurt airport. A medium size lounge sufficient choice of hot and cold foods generous choice of wines beers soft drinks. Wifi has to be paid for. Large choice of newspaper and magazines in different languages TV screens. I found staff in this lounge to be helpful and attentive.,4,0.550519389
W Fischer,Qatar Airways use the Coral Executive lounge for their frequent flyers / business class passengers. A medium size lounge comfortable with a relaxing atmosphere. Beach view fax telephone wifi newspapers. No toilets in the lounge but outside on departure hall. Good choice of hot and cold food and drinks - although there seem to be no wines (beers available). Meet and greet service you are zipped through immigration fast track to the lounge. Excellent staff welcoming and polite.,4,0.550519389
S Court,Business Terminal is a must. Transfer from the aircraft to terminal is smooth and fast Lounge is huge and cosy with a good selection of food and beverages. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Wireless internet access easy but a bit slow. Lavatories are not up to this kind of lounge standards.,4,0.550519389
Y Ren,Great restaurant service and food. Spa service fantastic. I had facial this time. Plenty of drinks and fruit available. Internet service good computers available as well. Private office is good for some last minute work.,5,1.333657488
Soeren Krumrey,The One world lounge in LAX is as bad as the rest of the airport the First lounge bit gets so cramped before the night time international flights go out that they have to ask passengers via the speaker system to keep all seats free from bags etc so that everyone gets a seat- being cramped into a lounge area with several complete strangers is not my idea of First! Entire feel is shocking and while they have quite nice food options and Champagne the service buffet maintenance etc are not up to scratch during busy periods.,2,-1.015756808
C Stevens,Small and confusing opening times especially when flights are delayed. The lounge closes you get asked to leave and then can re-enter once it opens later in the morning. Comfortable enough with usual food and drinks. No coffee barista. Wifi works and cold drinks are cold.,4,0.550519389
Savi Mull,The bus from the plane takes you directly to the Premium Terminal which has a wide atrium and divided into the business class section and first class section. The lounge was very spacious but crowded and busy on a Sunday morning. Had enough time to check out the food which has limited options on the lounge side but a full restaurant on the other. Quite impressive. Only downside was the busy washrooms. Shower facilities available. Adequate announcements were made for boarding and the boarding process was very smooth and efficient. Would fly through Doha again.,5,1.333657488
David Merrit,The Premium Lounge has always been a great experience - you almost want a delay. In the past year the business class side has doubled in size which it needed. I spent  hours in the lounge in  days (no delays just long transfers) and I give it %.,5,1.333657488
R Clarke,A big difference noticed now that the business class section has expanded as it got very crowded close to midnight when lots of flights leave after this time. Separate set of toilets are in the news section also so this helps relieve the overcrowded toilets problem. Food is average as are the selection of drinks and not much choice for snacks either. Internet seems to be extremely slow each time I have tried to use it and given up.,4,0.550519389
R Gonzaga,Used the lounge in the morning for an international flight to Kuala Lumpur. Large and spacious but somewhat dark. Adequate terminals and wi-fi was available. There was no hot food on offer in the morning just a selection of cereals fruit and yoghurt. A fried or boiled egg would have been nice. The coffee was very good as were the fruit juices on offer. Toilets were clean and well appointed with showers for use. Overall a nice experience but it would have been nice if they had a hot buffet for breakfast.,4,0.550519389
E Michael,Used the lounge when travelling British Airways F-class from HKG to LHR. Facilities are fair but not really up to many airlines First Class levels. The prospect of trying to snatch a meal/dinner before the flight was very limited and aside from some snack type foods or soup there was nothing. Staff at reception polite and friendly but no other service really offered in the lounge aside from cleaning staff. Shower facilities are at the basic end of the quality scale and very mean in terms of the amenities they offer. Not a patch on other Qantas lounges in Australia and clearly BA tries (yet again) to save by using this lounge for their customers (not even any BA branding visible.,3,-0.232618709
Mark Fenlon,The dedicated premium lounge at Doha is large comfortable and well appointed. Food okay nothing special. Drink choices are excellent. The men's wash room only has  toilets and  showers. If your transit time is short like mine (- hours) and you find the lounge is busy these facilities can become overwhelmed. So best to visit these facilities first before settling down. Qatar really need to address this issue soon.,4,0.550519389
David Dale,Lounge is spacious and ample seating. The food selection while not varied was abundant for the lounge. Shower amenities excellent however a bit concerning to see mould growing on the tiled walls. Catering staff asked if she could make sandwiches for me - a nice touch. Drinks ample. There is not much of a view from this lounge but not a problem for short stay. Internet wifi super.,4,0.550519389
T Patrick,Lots of free PC's and different types of seating. Busy but some seating. Really good range of drinks and snacks- no sandwiches but lots of hot food and salad if wanted. Very clean and lots of staff. Impressive.,5,1.333657488
D Weiss,Qantas has hired room  above gate  which is a fairly large area. Lounge had a good feel to it with plenty of food and drinks available. Staff good and children rooms and business computers plentiful. Only gripe would be the lack of toilets. Toilets were huge one toilet rooms and the lounge only had two per gender. Seeing as this route has only been operating the last  months this lounge is more than adequate for the one Qantas flight,4,0.550519389
A Mendoza,Premium Terminal is a bit confusing to get to as the bus operator from the plane makes no announcements. Once in the terminal there is a limited duty free shopping area (much smaller than the main terminal's) and a few gates. Upstairs is the lounge area for premium passengers. Service is good as you are greeted immediately upon arrival. From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd. Overall a very comfortable lounge but not much to do in the terminal for long stopovers.,5,1.333657488
Mark du Plessis,Still a great lounge although staff service seems to have fallen away in recent months. Buffet food has improved a bit from late last year but what makes me so mad is the poor internet / wifi service. Complained to lounge staff and they just shrug and say it is working fine!?,4,0.550519389
Ian Henderson,A pleasant lounge with showers and willing staff. Fine selection of food - wines not a great standard. Plenty of seating and computer positions. Sadly no view. Shared with BA - but few UK newspapers.,5,1.333657488
K Lofhjelm,Nice atmosphere comfortable lounges  great wifi stunning bathrooms but food choice very poor and no view or outlook.,4,0.550519389
J Brien,An exceptionally good a la carte food service provided and staff are very pleasant. Excellent computer facilities. Very modern and clean shower rooms with high quality amenities. The lounge also has a very good spa and massage area. Without question a better first-class lounge than any others that I have used.,5,1.333657488
Richard Woodhead,"Had a long transit with redeemed mileage ticket Bangkok to Manchester. As frequent flyer - Gold - able to use the Gold lounge at Doha. Small but very quiet throughout- marble shower and extremely helpful staff. Seating limited to quite upright lounge chairs. A good selection of food almost  hours. One negative comment the ""quiet room"" in the main terminal is anything but with constant tannoy announcements.",4,0.550519389
Patrick DuPlessis,Nice spacious lounge. Escorted from aircraft in BMW  series quick walk through security and into lounge. Enjoyed nice cooked breakfast fresh fruits etc - staff very friendly and efficient. Had a  hour stopover and managed to bag a bedroom where had a few hours rest before using shower room to freshen up. Good selection of mags/newspapers. WiFi was a little slow but internet terminals also in lounge were quick. Much more like a hotel than an airline lounge. Well done Qatar!,5,1.333657488
Dan Beaumont,Upon arrival you are directed to the First or Business lounge as appropriate and we experienced both (there being no first class seats available on our return journey). First lounge is an absolute haven - great selection of food and beverages comfy chairs and sofas sleep cabins if required spa and also a smoking room for those who require it. Good internet access although only a limited number of fixed terminals available - Wi-fi is free throughout though. Business lounge is similar to first but lacking in the sleep cabins and naturally much more crowded than First lounge. In both lounges staff are friendly and helpful and come around to announce your flight personally. Feeling a bit off-colour and in need of some antacid the staff directed me to the clinic where I was soon fixed up and got the feeling that they would have attended to pretty much any condition from which I was suffering. I think this is a great idea that should be widely copied. If you travel business class do be aware that the bus takes you to the regular terminal first so make sure you stay on board until you reach the premium terminal. This is no issue if you arrive first class as you are whisked from the plane in a -series BMW straight to the premium terminal.,5,1.333657488
K Franklin,I use this lounge a few times a year. Every time it is very crowded and thus noisy. Hardly a place to unwind before a flight or between connecting flights. In fact it is one of the most crowded lounges I use anywhere in the world.,4,0.550519389
L Mulholland,Great breakfast options. Free wifi. Lots of reading material and seating options. Great decor. Only gripe was the espresso coffee machine wasn't staffed until I was boarding at . The machine coffee was okay so I survived!,5,1.333657488
M Taylor,Best lounge I've been in. Staff so attentive without hovering. Spa treatments are first rate. Food in restaurant is cooked to order. A very pleasant experience and made a  hour transfer very tolerable.,5,1.333657488
D Morson,Transfer to the Premium terminal via Business class bus still confusing for first time users as the bus stops at the arrivals terminal and passengers are not informed they need to stay on the bus as  found out the hard way. New security measures in force on arrival into the Premium terminal - on clearing directed to First Class lounge. show to seats and refreshments offered immediately. Excellent service by pleasant staff. Area constantly cleaned nice to see clean tables not littered by previous guests drinks etc. Selection of both hot and cold food available. Able to take shower and shave in excellent shower room with quality amenities and excellent staff. Invited to board in a timely manner. Overall one of the best lounges visited.,4,0.550519389
Keith Stratton,We had a four hour transit at Doha the cost was Â£. each and certainly good value for money. The seating facility was spacious spotless and very pleasant to rest in. The food and beverage area was immaculate a good variety of snacks with hot and cold beverages being topped up all of the time even though there was no alcohol (Ramadan period). Towels were available for showers and the staff were all excellent and we would certainly use this lounge again,4,0.550519389
ANDREW WARD,Used business lounge in Qatar's new premium terminal in transit between London and Singapore and return. First point - coach from plane drops people at normal (old) terminal first - I thought there would be a separate coach for business class - we nearly got off at the wrong terminal as the information given is not that clear. New terminal is very impressive visually and well maintained. Reading material limited (on way back through early in the morning there wasn't any at all.) Would prefer a self service bar for wine/beers etc - there was a somewhat limited range of wines in the fridges available and no menus/drinks lists. Didn't look for or use PC so can't comment on Internet access. No announcements made staff wander round giving flight information and you can be sat some way away from screens giving flight info. Staff friendly enough but didn't volunteer any assistance. Given limited time available didn't have time to eat but there seemed to be a good variety of hot food available. Overall a very nice lounge but with a few minor improvements could be even better.,5,1.333657488
A Mackenzie,"Lufthansa lounge at LHR T. Large windows look out onto runways and taxiways with lots of activity. The lounge is spacious and airy, subdivided by freestanding furniture. So although the room is large, the ambiance is cosy and quiet. Various newspapers and magazines were available. The seating is mainly leather armchairs separated by table units. A dining area is equipped with dining tables and chairs, in front of a well stocked bar and food buffet. As a nice touch there was a big jug of ready made Pimms (with lots of fruit garnish) available as a celebration of Wimbledon. In the morning the food on offer was bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, plenty of breads, cold meats and various garnishes. At about am this changed to hot lunch items: rice, chicken casserole, pasta with sauce, soup and various other items. The staff were very unobtrusive and kept the place clean and tidy. WiFi was easy to use. As this is located in the new Queen's Terminal  everything is brand new.",6,2.116795586
G Moloney,A quiet comfortable lounge poor view outside. Food and beverages plentiful and good. I was doing some work with a colleague while waiting for our flight and found the wi-fi a bit slow but connection was easy and stable. Friendly staff who circulated constantly to keep the place clean.,5,1.333657488
P Walton,Stunning lounge. Food excellent surroundings tranquil and very comfortable. The lounge features a wall of green live plants. Washrooms and showers spotless and amenities were first class. Dining was excellent panoramic view of aprons.,5,1.333657488
Wasim Shaikh,Pretty decent lounge with reasonable airside view. Food selection is limited and expected more in an international lounge. Fairly spacious. Fast internet access. Overall -Star standard.,4,0.550519389
MARGARET KAVANAGH,Excellent atmosphere coupled with perfect service. If only airport lounges be this way. Service is friendly and confident they seems like well trained and genuine hospitable staff who cares. Attention to details is remarkable the flowers plats music and candles etc. Beverage service is excellent,,
Robert Riis,"The lounge consists of two lounges with the same entrance the Scandinavian Lounge on the th floor and the Business Lounge on the rd. I believe EuroBonus Silver card holders can access the Business Lounge during Summer time and from mid-december until mid-January and it is thus more crowded than the Scandinavian Lounge. The food selection is ok nothing extraordinary. The beverage selection is quite disappointing (one red wine one white wine one beer). The space is rather nice in classic ""Danish"" design. The best lounge in CPH.",3,-0.232618709
D Minto,SAS is one of my favorite airlines but please do something about the Stockholm lounge. The offering of food and drinks compared to Copenhagen and Helsinki are incredibly poor and gives the wrong impression of Swedish service and cuisine to visitors.,3,-0.232618709
Erez HarTal,Nice lounge nice ikea style decor. View of one of the gates at terminal  ample seating. Got in due to star alliance gold status (United). Nice spread of snacks much better than the swissport lounge in terminal . Roomy enough seating. Staff pleasant and helpful. Food ok compared to a lounge in the US.,4,0.550519389
Diane Lewthwaite,Service was excellent. I had a long wait and after a very relaxing massage and shower I was tired. A member of staff spoke to me when I stirred just to check what flight I was on so he could wake me if I appeared to be sleeping through the flight boarding call. Could improve the amenities in the showers however for a first class lounge you expect female amenities rather than the more general ones.,5,1.333657488
Steve Conroy,As per previous comments - a small lounge which comfortably accommodates a full business/star class cabin and QF Club members. Not a lot is provided in the way of television entertainment however food and beverages are well stocked. Staff are very friendly and only too willing to help. Wi-Fi is confusing: as this lounge is shared with American Airlines it uses their pay- per-use wi-fi. This service is provided free to QF passengers. Talk to the desk staff who will provide you with details of how to log-in. This lounge certainly beats the cramped and uncomfortable departure lounges in HNL airport.,4,0.550519389
Nicholas Janides,Qantas Club at HNL is quite small but run by friendly staff who are available for assistance. The food and beverage areas are small but well stocked. I was there for a morning flight and was happy with the pastries cereal and fruits on offers.,5,1.333657488
M Jakobsen,The lounge itself is nice but hard to find. Visited between .-.. Food selection was a bowl of oatmeal som vegetables chips and dip. You cold also choose between apple and orange juice different kind of (coca cola brand) sodas beer or vine. The lounge is self serviced.,3,-0.232618709
H Singler,Unacceptable Internet (WiFi) access - Connection is disconnected several times during all my last stays the last  years at this Lounge. My colleagues had always the same problem. In no other lounge we had so much problems with internet access. Temperature especially during the summer months is way too high this is very inconvenient. After complaining several times at the front desk nothing happens even no explanation why this problem cannot be fixed. This is really unprofessional.,3,-0.232618709
A Petersen,Disappointed with this lounge in CPH. The lounge is features a modern design. Food selection is ok and food is quite tasty. Drinks selection very poor no wifi (staff informed me that wifi had not been working for over a month) and lounge very crowded.,2,-1.015756808
David Martin,Staff although helpful appeared to think keeping things clean was beneath them. The cleanliness of the place needed to be stepped up a notch for me. Quality of the food was average the fact they shut the coffee bar was completely odd. I was told to use a cheap vending machine? Range of wines and other beverages generally good.,3,-0.232618709
Rob Johnson,A really small and uninviting lounge compared to the normal QF fare. Incredibly quiet - everyone was whispering! No TV internet. Almost no food (packets of chips only for most of my stay then a few sandwiches) and no staff noticed when the wine ran out. Why not use the BA lounge instead?,3,-0.232618709
S Conroy,A clean and tidy lounge - although by the time all eligible passengers are in the lounge it can be quite cramped and busy. It is operated by two staff who work hard when the lounge is full as it serves both JQ and QF flights including QC members traveling on JetStar economy. I recommend arriving early as access can be denied when the lounge hits peak capacity. There can be a lengthy queue to enter at times as there is only one person manning the reception desk and she must record your details manually as you enter. Food and beverage amenities are adequate. There is no television but there are  PC terminals. WiFi coverage is a bit confusing as most pax needing access needed staff assistance to log in. Overall a good lounge and an alternative to the bus shelter that is HNL terminal.,4,0.550519389
M Gustafsson,I visited this lounge on March  between :-:. The lounge can often be crowded but not at this early morning occasion. The breakfast offered was very good and tasteful including plenty of selections. The offerings regarding breakfast has however not been changed for a long time. It would be nice with some kind of variation even if the overall concept is very good. The lounge needs some upgrades since especially the (rather cosy) sofas and armchairs starts to get relatively worn and threadbare. The Internet access is easy and fast and I have never experienced any problem top class. The variety of newspapers and magazines are good. The staff are nice and service minded and keep the tables clean and tidy.,4,0.550519389
Magnus Gustafsson,I visited SAS Business Lounge available for travellers in SAS Plus at STockholm Arlanda Airport. The interior of the lounge is ok but nothing special. The assortment of food and drinks are very poor. The lounge was also quite crowded.,3,-0.232618709
Cato Haukeland,The lounge is quiet and clean with a good selection of beverages. However when it comes to getting some food to fill you up (high in protein) there is not many options. The food served is generally healthy but it's lacking protein sources like fish chicken meat and so on. In this regard lounges at VIE FRA are better options.,4,0.550519389
L Norton,Crowded. One main seating area mainly lounge seats with some cafe tables next to the bar but also separate areas to watch TV. Very limited selection of food although could purchase some cafe style meals. Complimentary vouchers (/person) for drinks. There is a small children's room with electronic games and computer. Bathrooms located only at one end of lounge which seems a long way from TV areas. Only  computers were available on the evening we flew (other  out of action) which seems inadequate for such a busy lounge.,2,-1.015756808
D Weiss,Never in many years of travel have I experienced such a bad First Class lounge. Was there mid- morning no food selection to speak of just cereals. Plenty of champagne though. Tiny area with not enough seats for the - flights that leave around am. Received a very late boarding call resulting in us holding up the plane as it was ready to leave. Compared to most Qantas lounges in the world this was disgraceful. Qantas need to re-think how they treat their platinum members especially considering that this lounge also caters for the EVA air flight and JAL.,2,-1.015756808
Alan Wan,I was an Air New Zealand Business Class ticket holder and I was surprised the plane did not depart from T like most Star Alliance flights but discovered ANZ code share with JAL hence T. Anyway I arrived from T on the inter terminal shuttle and asked at the transfer desk which lounge I could use and I was directed to the Qantas business lounge. I had a shower and used the internet stations. The choice of food was okay - nothing specatular. For a  minute use the lounge did the job well.,4,0.550519389
Magnus Gustafsson,"Scandinavian Airlines lounge at Stockholm Arlanda Airport is ok but at a lower standard than the average Star Alliance lounges at to other airport lounges within the Europe. The lounge is well situated if you have a departure from gate - otherwise not. The lounge can at some times during the day be very overcrowded. The variation of drinks is good but the food served has not been changed for many years and there is no variation to the menu. The food and snacks offered is often ""healthy and sound"" but gives the impression that it is composed based on guidelines from the Swedish Government Health Ministry. This is a modern and sound lounge but this makes unfortunately the longe a bit boring and too ""Scandinavian perfect"".",3,-0.232618709
Magnus Gustafsson,The SAS lounge at Copenhagen Airport is well situated and has plenty of seats and is seldom overcrowded. The variation of drinks is good and the food served is good and is relatively often altered. The food is to my opinion the best of all SAS lounges but does still not fully match the food served at fellow Star Alliance member Lufthansa at its hubs at FRA MUC and DUS. The atmospere in the SAS lounge is however very nice with a typical Danish touch that to my opinion could be even further developed for the benefit of the experience.,5,1.333657488
Magnus Gustafsson,"This SAS lounge is very often overcrowded. The variation of both food and drinks is very limited. The lounge is frequently visited by Swedish politicians and civil servants from the Swedish public administration representing the Swedish Government. This may be one of the reasons for the poor and very restricted offering since Swedish government employees is normally not allowed to drink or eat during business trips if not on their own expenses. I guess that SAS as still partially government owned have considered the above fact an adjusted this lounge to be ""political correct"".",2,-1.015756808
A Donnellan,I have written before extolling the virtues of this lounge and there are none better. Have just finished a delicious breakfast of eggs benedict with smoked trout two of the best lattes I have ever tasted and fresh OJ. The staff here are warm friendly and helpful. It is the best way to start a  hour flight to the US.,4,0.550519389
J Andrews,To be honest the QF domestic Business class lounge is not much different from the QF Club. Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean. Also noted that the tiles in the male toilets had been stripped off revealing the besa-brick construction (very attractive!).,2,-1.015756808
Jim Henderson,Qantas use the JAL Business class lounge at SFO as they do not have their own. As there are no JAL flights departing concurrently with the Qantas flight it is exclusively used by Qantas passengers. The lounge is designed with Japanese passengers in mind seats are small and lined in a row not in way that allows groups to sit and face each other. There are a limited range of snacks but plenty to choose from in the fridge. Bathrooms are clean but no shower facilities. Wifi is the standard T-mobile paid service.,3,-0.232618709
J Ahlers,Very limited food no international newspapers (only scrap leftovers) slow Wifi Star Alliance Gold customers are blocked from SAS Fast Lane - stay away from SAS lounge and CPH airport!,2,-1.015756808
D Kandi,I have given SAS a lot of stick over the years. But credit where credit is due. The lounge in Copenhagen is slightly refurbished. Very homy and nordic design. Certain parts like the bathroom and shower facilities are stuck in a less modern state. They have quiet areas. The bar is not stocked with a lot of wines and liquer. The bar offers - red and white wines soft drinks and water coffee etc. The food is mostly the same. The staff is helpful in regards to boarding passes changing flights and other assistance.,4,0.550519389
K Arentoft,"Really enjoy the SAS lounge in Copenhagen airport - especially now when it have been partly refurbished. Cosy and ""homy"" atmosphere love the fireplace and new seats simple - but good - food (seems to have been updated) service minded staff. Good place to be - like Copenhagen airportt in general.",4,0.550519389
E Hochstatter,I think this is the case where the hype is better than the reality. Whilst the Qantas First Class lounge in Sydney is very nice with its openness and design the lack of attention to detail lets it down. The first impression upon entering the main lounge - a dirty floor going up the escalator to the top floor. Toilets - not only was the floor filthy beyond belief but two out of the four toilet stalls were either not flushed or had excrement in them. When I informed reception of this they told me that they just had a lot of flights leaving. Is this suppose to be an excuse? If they knew this then someone should have been right on it. Nearly half of the computers did not work. One had a virus warning flashing on the screen! The restaurant had an excellent selection of food which was tasty and made to order. The wine selection was the best I have seen. Also the spa centre was brilliant! I had the best face and neck massage that I can recall. Although my wife was less impressed with her manicure. Overall this is a very good lounge but is let down by a lack of attention to detail.,4,0.550519389
Bill Atkin,Friendly and enthusiastic staff good service clean and well maintained and plenty of space. Good food choices - all in all a sense of really being appreciated.,4,0.550519389
H Haasma,Mostly I visit the lounge between -. During  years the breakfast has been the same no surprise or thrill. Lounge is old and worn and would be better with refurbishing. Staff is okay not too fast to clean empties away but okay. You get a nice welcome and when passing the front desk. For later flights the food (especially lunch) could be improved a lot. Getting tired of Cold smoked lax and salad/spinach. But drink selection is perfect.,3,-0.232618709
Magnus Gustafsson,The lounge has a relatively nice design and atmosphere but it was cramped with people and hard to find any seats. The food is more or less always the same some kind of salmon salad and cream cheese -very limited variation and range. Staff friendly but not as service-minded as SAS cabin crew.,4,0.550519389
Magnus Gustafsson,I frequently visit SAS Scandinavian Airlines lounge at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport Terminal . The atmosphere in the lounge is relatively relaxing but the lounge is normally far too occupied and there has been no improvement for several years in that aspect. The meal service is very limited and is normally made up of some variant of salmon with cheese creme. The breakfast has never changed during the last - years but is better than the food served during the rest of the day. Some more ideas would be mostly welcomed. The variety of soft drinks wines and spirits are ok. There are plenty of newspapers and magazines and very easy access to Internet via wi-fi.,4,0.550519389
A Silva,Very small accommodation for  passengers which is the maximum per A. The lounge is small when two or more simultaneous flights. We found it unattended and receptionists not too concerned with the well-being of passengers. The lounge is equipped with a tiny bar and refrigerator was padlocked. No special service as far as access to the aircraft. In a scale - I give them a  on the account that at least the door was opened.,1,-1.798894906
Garth Freeman,What a surprise compared to the hideous Admirals Club in Terminal . Hot meals (chilli con carne chicken stir fry etc with rice and noodles) choice of  beers good red and white wines and spirits bar. Plenty of PC's to catch up with emails courteous attentive staff. Great shower rooms although the water outlets need replacement. Plenty of space in a quiet relaxing environment. Can get a little crowded when  hours from  flights departing. Overall especially in terms of lounges in the US very good.,4,0.550519389
T Newman,The ambience is active but quiet. From the telephone call the day before asking us what time we would be arriving so the kurbside porter could help us with our luggage to the boarding of the plane all needs were met. My partner was wished a Happy Birthday from every staff member who met us at check in at the Lounge entrance and after our meal in the Lounge restaurant where my partner was presented with a small birthday platter of fruit. All this occurred by a mere mention of the event during my telephone conversation the day before.,5,1.333657488
J Simiana,Used this lounge while flying back to Canada via Copenhagen and Frankfurt. Attractive spacious good supply of magazines and newspapers. Ample snacks and drink choices. A comfortable spot to while away some time before boarding.,4,0.550519389
D Kusiak,Standard SAS Business Class lounge. Comfortable but nothing special. No other choices at this airport for Star Alliance passengers.,3,-0.232618709
A Mitchell,This lounge is immaculately maintained - as was stated previously can become somewhat irritating as they will pounce on a finished glass of drink or cleared plate - can't really complain though. The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find. But it handles to steady flow of numbers very well and never feels full despite the time of day.,4,0.550519389
A Donnellan,The staff were attentive and friendly. As there is no airside pharmacy in Sydney international a staff member actually took my script had it filled at a pharmacy in another part of the airport had it cleared by security and delivered to my table. Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place. This lounge is the only reason that I will continue to use Qantas it's a great benefit for platinum frequent flyers- Qantas inflight service could learn a lot from this lounge.,5,1.333657488
Roger Tilling,Very clean spacious lounge split between two floors. Good selection of cold food - salad cold meats cheese bread coleslaw etc. Extensive selection of wines beer spirits soft drinks. The washrooms are clean. There is a variety of seating designs - bar-style sofa areas dining tables quiet rooms and television rooms. Very clean airy impressive.,4,0.550519389
Christopher Jonsson,SAS Business Lounge on Terminal  is a small but efficient Lounge but the place is in need of remodeling - its very worn out and in need of a facelift. Other than that its a standard kind of lounge with polite staff the snacks are pretty good sadly they don't offer shower cabins!,3,-0.232618709
J Roggeveen,Sydney business lounge very spacious with nice views. Food quality good hot food offering of soup and meat pies a little disappointing but cold meats cheese were of a high standard and bread was fresh. Lounge feels too modern could do with some nice artwork to enliven the space. Nice light fixtures particularly at the large communal style wine bar. Plenty of room to relax and find privacy if needed. Nice mix of seating arrangements. Nice showers. Overall a pleasant pre flight experience.,4,0.550519389
B Stewart,The renovated Qantas Club at Perth International is a vast improvement over the old one. It's looks and feels like the other Mark Newson designed Qantas lounges with the seemingly larger space punctuated with different areas serving different purposes. The toilet and shower facilities are also much improved while the food and drink on offer has not changed since the old days. The only major gripe would be the extremely warm temperature of the lounge which was acknowledged by the receptionist as being problematic.,4,0.550519389
S Davis,Thought the lounge was excellent in a functional way - not luxurious. Typical Scandinavian decor and lighting - clean and bright. Plenty of computers (Macs). I was there at breakfast time and they had a good selection of food drink newspapers and magazines. It was a bit full apparently they have another seating area upstairs. Bathrooms just so-so would have expected tip top cleanliness but no. Staff impersonal.,4,0.550519389
Tore Fredriksen,There are two SAS lounges at Oslo Airport,,
Torsten Hvas,I do not know why the SAS staff act like in the old monopoly times food downright disappointing the staff need a training in service and kindness.,3,-0.232618709
R Ganbich,I use this lounge regularly and quite enjoy it. It is relatively centrally located or at least easy to reach through fast-track calm and spacious. The staff are relaxed and friendly. Newspaper selection good but sometimes worn out in the evening. The drinks selection is very good with one exception - seems very difficult to get an ordinary glass of water carbonated or non-carbonated. The food is simple but substantial and one can have a healthy snack or small meal. There is a section with good views - this is however let down by the constant blare of a TV with CNN.,4,0.550519389
A Ward,Quite nicely designed but very poor selection of food reading materials and drinks. Overall very dull with no real flair.,3,-0.232618709
Kerrie Staples,A bit hard to find but well worth it. Quiet seating areas - booths tables and lounges. Wide variety of food and snacks. Short stroll to SAS gate. Would have liked some written instructions for the wireless internet access.,3,-0.232618709
M Rapp,Nice and comfortable place with a very relaxing atmosphere (lounge was nearly empty). Food variety is limited but this is usually healthy and fresh stuff. Good choice of drinks and newspapers. Washroom facilities are very limited. Free wireless internet or PC stations.,3,-0.232618709
RON MERRITT,SAS shares lounge with Asiana at SeaTac and the lounge is quite small about the size of an average family's rec room. Bizarrely there are no phones with local service available in the lounge. All phones in the F/J class lounge are pay phones and require a credit card to swipe first to make local calls. I complained to the lounge hostess and it appeared that I was the only passenger to ever have complained about not being able to make a local call without charge from the lounge. United's RCC at SEA has free local phones and I believe that is standard at most RCC facilities. The SAS lounge at SEA is also quite warm.,4,0.550519389
T Holt,I was greeted by a friendly staff. There was a very tasty and extensive western and mid-eastern food selection and many hot and cold beverages. Beef tenderloin was dry. Frequent table bussing. There was free WiFi that worked fine. Air conditioning was comfortable as was seating. I would enjoy another four hour layover there.,5,1.333657488
B Al Omar,Simply disappointing. I was really frustrated by the computer facility and the internet connection. After having a look at the food presented I simply grabbed a coffee and cake from the Cinnabon Cafe opposite the lounge. It just looked so dull.,1,-1.798894906
H Maas,The lounges in Dammam are horrible and it would rank it the worst I have ever seen. I do not understand why Skyteam is not setting minimum standards for business class lounges as the Saudia lounges have no international standard as far as I am concerned.,2,-1.015756808
C Todd,Very poor. Has the basics but very little. Screens telling you of departure times and gates are in Arabic then  seconds in English. Even if it was in English it would be pointless because they put your gate up about  mins before it opens then everyone runs and form a massive queue from the front. I waited for  mins in a queue because flight was delayed and they never opened gate. When I got to the front they said that it was for a different flight and then I had to go to the back of another queue. Disgrace is too good a word for this airport. I have travelled here on and off maybe  times in past  months and still the same.,2,-1.015756808
P Elliott,"We used Scoot in Style with our booking. That allowed us entry to the SATS Lounge in Changi Terminal . It is shown on the barcode of your boarding pass and that is scanned at entry. The lounge is quite big and well worth the cost. Plenty of drinks, alcoholic (whiskey, wine, gin, vodka) and soft. The coffee is delicious.. Everything is self serve, so you can eat as much as you like. Best was the beef stew, nice and tender. Staff were cleaning all the time and topping things up. For a  - hour stop, you could easily recoup value for the cost.",6,2.116795586
J Gray,A light and airy lounge and very spacious. A good selection of work stations lounge chairs and dining arrangements. Wine beer and non-alcholic drinks were available but they had completely run out of glasses and were using paper cups. The food was mediocre - just a small selection of sandwiches and some noodles. Overall it was comfortable and pleasant but not outstanding.,3,-0.232618709
Paul Matthews,An okay lounge compared to Air China facility at this airport. Have to go up to top floor in lift and most irritating aspect was the smell of cigarette smoke - despite this lounge being non smoking. A fair selection of Chinese style food is provided and limited choice of drinks. Staff very nice and friendly but cannot speak much English. Internet service was not that good and the choice of newspapers is of course rather limited. A pleasant alternative to the main terminal waiting areas.,3,-0.232618709
L McKenzie,We used Sichuan airlines domestic first class lounge in Beijing this April. The lounge is small in size and could seat  passengers. It offers a small selection of snacks a coffee machine beer and soft drinks. The lounge is long and has sofas one side and  VIP rooms on the other. The staff speak good English and were helpful. The one let down was no english news papers or english TV but i was in china and not my own country. Overall i would recommend using Sichuan airlines domestic first the lounge was clean and comfortable and the price was right.,4,0.550519389
A Henneka,Le Anfore handling agent lounge. Worst lounge I have been in. Very little food. What there is is stale. Staff are okay but not very happy nor helpful. Dirty toilets. Men's toilet did not even have a seat!,1,-1.798894906
Alan Wan,"I was flying Turkish Airlines and as a Star Alliance Gold member I had a choice of a number of lounges. I tried the United Airlines lounge first as I heard some positive reviews. However also decided to try the Singapore Airlines lounge. I arrived at around .am. As well as the expected English breakfast buffet, I was glad to see Chicken Sambal on offer. It was really excellent: chicken on the bone (or rather falling off the bone) and I added rice, hard boiled egg and chilli - I really really enjoyed it. I accompanied my brunch with a glass of champagne. The decor was very agreeable, lots of brown leather seating and a good view of the apron. The lounge is not as big at the UA lounge and it does not offer as much natural light. But the decor and food offering makes it a better lounge for me.",6,2.116795586
Andreas Rudorfer,The Kris Flyer Gold Lounge in Singapore is miserable. The food hasn't changed for a long time and I am flying SIA regularly. No showers no rest areas.  A shame for a top airline.,1,-1.798894906
S Paice,Huge lounge with a great selection of food and ample drinks. Superb showers that were cleaned after every use by the attendant and I was even whisked into the first class shower units as there was a queue and 'they didn't want me to have to wait'. Only downside is the lack of nap cabins or a quiet area for a long stop over. Internet was a bit hit/miss very difficult to connect to but worked well when it finally connected.,5,1.333657488
N Law,Very spacious lounge. The individual desk carrels in the back are extremely comfortable and ideal for work. Staff were quite nice. Food was less than mediocre. Biggest drawback is that lounge is a giant den with no windows so mobile reception was iffy at times.,4,0.550519389
P Borschberg,"The lounge is one floor down from the departure gates and there are no signs to guide passengers specifically to the the Silverkris Lounge (in contrast to SIA's competitors). Follow the sign that reads: ""Other lounges"". The premises appear tired and worn with what looks like s decor. This lounge is definitely in need of refurbishment. The bright white neon lights lend it a cafeteria feel. Food and beverage offerings were limited by SIA standards.",2,-1.015756808
N Law,Good variety of drinks. Decent selection of food choices. Chairs not exactly the most comfortable. Big negative is no toilets but it appears from other reviews that this is an issue with other lounges in this airport.,4,0.550519389
Murray Tannington,They treat Star Alliance Gold Members as the lower class. Food is not nice no showers not comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this lounge to no one. Airport is nice but Gold Lounge is not comfortable at all.,1,-1.798894906
Paul Budd,A very comfortable if not undersized lounge for the demand placed by the mid-afternoon volume of FFs and Premium passengers on the A. Food choice was 'good' at best however with the volumes of food offered on board the plane the selection of tasty cold bites and a few hot dishes was more than enough. Staff were exceptional and the hostesses circulated the masses and offered Champagne refills without prompt - a nice touch. The lounge is relatively well appointed but there was no spare seating capacity and I can anticipate this becoming an issue if other Star Alliance FFs flock there given the airlines reputation for high standards in its lounges.,4,0.550519389
Pete Fitzgerald,If you are expecting an experience comparable to the very good services provided by the silver kris lounge in a Singapore you will get a shock. This is a cramped unattractive space with limited facilities that does not compare well with Singapore Airlines overall business class product.,2,-1.015756808
R Hazra,The Port Lounge is a relatively small lounge in Kolkata airport but the food choices weren't bad (Chinese and Indian veg and non-veg including rice fish and other items),,
S Raney,"We were flying out on Silk air so my normal Star Alliance entrance wasn't applicable. So we used our priority pass card. The lounge was horrible. Stained furniture carpets exposed cables etc. The small amount of food there was looked like it had been there for days. No alcoholic beverages. The whole place looked like a  soviet style lounge. Needless to say we left after  minutes. Then they had the nerve to charge my card $ for each of us even though we should have a free visit! Do not go near Singapore priority pass lounges. I would give them ""zero"" stars for most choices.",1,-1.798894906
C Young,Very average. Every time I am here there seems to be a good gossip session going on among the staff loud and given it is not a self serve bar totally absent when it comes to offering a drink or being at the bar when one is looking for a drink. Much prefer the London lounge a business class lounge close by. Food looks like it has been sitting out forever and again staff don't approach to offer anything from the menu. A shame as Singapore Airlines in flight service is terrific.,2,-1.015756808
Casper Yap,Being the HQ large clean lounge. No sleeping rooms like in FC lounge. Bathroom with showers excellent.,4,0.550519389
David Jenkins,Visited the Singapore Airlines T lounge at London Heathrow as a passenger with Thai Airways en route to BKK. Star Alliance lounge share. As always lounge was peaceful. Good flow of fresh foods with staff preparing more pastries when they ran short. A much better option than using the London Lounge suggested by Thai as that is a shared First and Business lounge.,5,1.333657488
A Calvert,New lounge fit-out looks sleek. I travel through Sydney a lot and it was desperate for an upgrade. Staff are friendly. Food really average buffet was cold and tasteless.

K How,Visited on th December their new revamped lounge. Everything okay and considering they spent some money doing it up they did not really put any effort into the food side. What was on offer was cold meat pie cold grilled sausages curries that were lukewarm (beef rendang that did not even look like the real thing) Chinese congee that had very few condiments and a few other dishes of similar temperature. All served buffet style and obviously as time went by the food becomes less appetizing. Considering they have the Australian consulting chef Matt Moran on SIA's culinary panel why did they not use his talents to come up with something more original like gourmet appetizers rather than the same old tired food formulas. What a disappointment they did not think out of the box in the food department. I wonder why SIA does not win any awards as offering the best airport lounges?,3,-0.232618709
J Stoiber,"Adelaide Airport - we always make a point of arriving early at any airport and taking time then to relax (approx -/ hours) but Customs (international gates) at this airport do not open until  minutes prior to the international flight so we were unable to access the small Singapore Airlines lounge downstairs. We had assumed that as Virgin are Singapore Airlines ""partner"" airlines we could use their lounge. Definite not. The customer service lady only granted us access to the Virgin lounge because it was empty we have a Bronze Card and were over . Compare that to the excellent Qantas lounge that we had used in the past!",4,0.550519389
G Sternfeld,The seating is ok and the decor is simple. This is definitely not the newest lounge and has very little atmosphere. Drink options are unimaginative and not impressive. The only real upside I have to say is that the food is quite good (not many options) - definitely better than the Economy class fare onboard so I always tend to eat my meal in the lounge. WiFi works but is not super fast. The lounge is kept quite tidy by the staff.,3,-0.232618709
P Dunkley,The lounge is far too crowded facilities dated and insufficient even for a  never mind an A. Food selection limited to a couple of noodles and a few wilting sandwiches. As for the champagne don't start me on that. Even to wifi was intermittent. The lounge is not disabled friendly with an elevator which has no sides or back to the moving parts.,2,-1.015756808
Steve Siauw,Different from the better Changi Airport's Krisflyer Elite Gold/Silverkris lounges this one in London is a little bit dirty with some leftovers stains on the carpet more limited choices of drinks no proper meal offered only some tiny tasteless sandwiches and crisps. It's also a lot smaller and much more noisy compared to those in Singapore.,3,-0.232618709
J Joslin,Travelling back to Auckland from Heathrow and after a tedious journey to the airport and then the bun fight getting through check- in and immigration etc we were looking forward to getting in to the Business class lounge to relax and refresh ourselves before the long flight. No chance the lounge was small crowded hot and rundown. The food was minimal consisting of packets of cheese a few biscuits some miserable looking sandwiches and the odd piece if tired fruit fruit. What a let down for a  Star airline. Extremely disappointing. Changi was better and so it should be as it is presumably their showplace lounge but not fabulous.,2,-1.015756808
Paul Sagorski,Lounge was a bit dated however food was great. fantastic variety and very fresh. However did run a little low on portions once it became a bit crowded. Loved the Asian curry.,4,0.550519389
Elizabeth Dossetor,This lounge has no toilet - let alone a shower! It was also very warm. Having got off a long flight from Sydney I was most unhappy. The whole idea of flying business and having access to these lounges is to have an advantage over the rest of the travelers. Not having a toilet and shower is ridiculous! The lounge pleasant enough and service very good but food ordinary.,3,-0.232618709
Sam James,Used their Changi Airport lounge before heading to Sydney. Facility design is impressive but that's about all this lounge offers. Food are in substandard condition and beverages just as limited as the onboard offering. Too many people about and unsure if it was because I entered during peak times but it felt really cramped. Some tables still had leftover plates and drinks making it look shabby. This lounge does not have bathroom facilities and was told to walk couple hundred metres out of the lounge which I found incomprehensible. Lounge staff pretty much non existent other than at the reception area where they were rude and disgruntled. Very poor lounge to relax in and not worth lugging your bags into.,1,-1.798894906
D Chin,"Silver Kris lounge in T - it is a beautiful room ruined by despicable customer service. There were at least five staff in the front desk and not one smiled or made anyone feel welcomed. I watch in astonishment when ""elite"" passengers were treated like passengers on a bus in a third world country. I don't know if anyone from Singapore airlines will see or read this but the staff on duty on the night of the st of May  should really be reviewed especially a short haired Eurasian looking lady. Wished I caught her name but really Singapore airlines needs to lift their game here. When travellers are spending copious amount of money to fly with you make us feel at least welcomed? Silver Kris lounge in T - I left T because of the overall lack of respect to customers. But what I found in T was the direct opposite. This is where everything came good. Staff were so polite and helpful. Goes to show that it does not matter how much you spend on perfecting facilities when you don't have the right people.",3,-0.232618709
M Bertram,The lounge in Adelaide is quite small with no windows but it is only for Singapore Airlines passengers so it didn't really feel all that crowded despite being small. One major advantage is that unlike all of the other lounges it is after immigration and security checks so once you reach the lounge you can just relax. The food and beverage selection is small but sufficient and the toilets (there are ) are clean.,4,0.550519389
M Bertram,Overall a clean and comfortable lounge (both in Terminal  and Terminal ) with a good selection of food. There are no boarding announcements however so make sure to check your ticket for boarding times.,4,0.550519389
C Wajsberg,Lounge is large and comfortable with a nice view of airport. Wifi is working well. Food choice is good and ranges from salads to hot soup chicken as warm pasta and more. Drinks are served at the bar by the glass for booze and wine. Soft drinks and beers are served in cans. Not much reading material but a decent lounge to relax before a long flight.,4,0.550519389
Tim Griggs,As a gold frequent flyer I was looking forward to relaxing in a lounge on the way back to Australia flying with Singapore Airlines. Given that Singapore Airlines is based at Changi I had high expectations of the lounge quality. However I was directed to the gold lounge that was very disappointing indeed. No service cramped seating flat beer mangy sandwiches and no toilet! I think that Virgin should look for a better code share partner if this is the standard Singapore Airlines have to offer.,1,-1.798894906
J Wilson,"This lounge was by the far the worst we have ever experienced. It was shabby the staff were rude or just grunted. There were only two toilets one of which was out of order and this was not even clean. The noise level with dishes being clanged and banged at the bar area was unbelievable. SIA need to engage in some serious conversations with Roma airport as the advertising states that ""the Le Anfore Business Class Lounge offers a haven of peace from Rome Fiumicino Airport. Treat yourself to the VIP lifestyle!"" - well it doesn't!",2,-1.015756808

K Pahkim,Large lounge overlooking the tarmac. Lots of different zones to sit in but it got really crowded with Start Alliance and SAA flights using this facility.

Avoid this lounge its a lousy excuse for a lounge. I hope Priority Pass takes notice and stops ripping off customers in this way. Its totally not worth it.,2,-1.015756808
T King,Very good lounge - lots of food on offer though the selection did not change during my  hour stay. The seating was comfy and offering good privacy. The staff were very helpful and even when I walked in and out of the lounge regularly they did not raise a fuss and ask for a boarding pass. The toilets were clean with great showers that were well stocked. The wi-fi was easy to access.,5,1.333657488
R van Niekerk,Refreshing clean well staffed and friendly. Didn't mind spending time here waiting for my flight. Staff were very friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome on arrival and departure. What you would expect from a business class lounge.,4,0.550519389
E Roberts,The layout itself is not very appealing and the food selection is quite basic. I don't take pre flight drinks but the choice I noticed was very limited and the access poor.,3,-0.232618709
J Gray,A large comfortable lounge with good amenities (including smoking room TV room children's room and showers). A nice selection of packaged sandwiches and wraps and a bar with a good range of alcoholic beverages as well as a proper espresso machine. Staff were friendly and pleasant.,4,0.550519389
Y Ren,It was really disappointing to access SQ Gold Lounge at Terminal  and Terminal . No shower facilities available in either lounges. It mainly affects Gold member who transit in Singapore. Gold members are not allowed to access business lounge Singapore gold members do not usually need shower facilities at departure only these poor transit Gold members. It is a big disappointment. After a long flight a shower could make huge difference. Food and drink were limited you don't want to drink a lot anyway because there is no toilet inside the lounge. You have to go outside and bring all your belongings and come back again. So it is another strategy to encourage you drink less and move on quickly. It is really not a lot of point to build up your SQ points you get less and less for benefit.,3,-0.232618709
S Fazl,Lounge is small with very limited food and drink on offer. Not up to the standard of other carrier lounges in Sydney. The restrooms are also very small. I left to eat some overpriced airport food.,3,-0.232618709
M Mejia,SilverKris business class lounge at Changi airport is quite spacious with excellent choice of food offerings. The bar had a good choice of wines and non alcoholic drinks. Good wifi although had a couple of attempts at logging in. Staff service only mediocre as they did not bother to see who was there and kept pestering everybody in the lounge (a total of less than  passengers) more than once about missing passengers on some SIA flights. The place was rather claustrophobic without windows and did not have the general airy feeling that was usual at Changi. For a short layover I would just go to the lounge for the food and drinks but exit to enjoy the excellent airport that Changi is.,4,0.550519389
Jay Denbakker,"Checked in at am en route to JNB and Hong Kong. On arrival at the lounge counter staff were chatting among themselves - not really interested
Keith Rogers,Great new lounge SAA has in place now from the World Cup. Large and comfortable. Free wifi smoking room good views on tarmac food good expresso machine run by staff instead of just self serve. Overall great new installation in the airlines home airport.,5,1.3336574878175844
M Shah,Very large lounge with plenty of sofa style dining recliner seating. Seperate kids area smoking zone TV zone work stations etc. The bar is manned and decent selection of drinks. Food selection is average for J class lounge. No hot food just sandwiches fruit and salads. Excellent showers and bathroom facilities. The staff felt too much at home and were loud and obtrusive. Excellent view over the aprons. Free WiFi. Overall great lounge.,4,0.5505193893044773
Ian Reed,Sitting here at  hours wondering what happened to SIA's famed food/hospitality. There is one member of staff for the whole lounge serving drinks topping up food (more later) clearing tables etc. The sum total of hot food available is a tureen of lukewarm leek and potato soup. That's it unless you like the one variety of sandwich available or scone and cream or microwave noodles. As for access it's a slog up the stairs or a ride in the service lift. Paint peeling off the radiator in the Gent's loos. Truly low grade compared with their rivals. I had more choice free of charge on the train coming down - bacon sandwiches scrambled egg and smoked salmon for example.,3,-0.23261870920862976
C Barkei,Excellent lounge in Singapore with plenty of room. Good food and wines on offer. Only available for Business passengers on C class tickets not to Star Alliance Gold card holders. Krisflyer Gold card holders in economy must use the lounge next door. Seems a bit off to not allow a larger lounge and have *G use the facilities. I understand that the First Class lounge is currently being renovated and therefore F pax are also using this lounge.,5,1.3336574878175844
Anthony Allen,Even as a solitaire member you don't get access to the first class lounge. The business class lounge is really busy on a Thursday evening waiting for the Singapore flight people had to stand. There is rubbish on the tables that does not seem to get cleared for hours. I don't know how much SIA pay for using this but it's too much.,2,-1.0157568077217367
M Shah,SAA have an arrivals lounge just after you clear customs before exiting into the arrivals lounge. It is well marked to the left and upstairs. It is not large but has  excellent showers good selection of food (breakfast was cereal toast pastries sandwiches fruit tea/coffee etc.) No alcoholic beverages. Smoking room. Comfortable seating. Again the staff are too loud and obtrusive but provide good service. Free WiFi.,4,0.5505193893044773

Tom Pieters,As we were flying first on Emirates we had access to the South African Airways lounge. First class passengers were directed to the right and business class pax to the left. The lounge is not really big but it has all one needs except wifi. There are  computers but the connection is really slow. There is a nice coffee corner with snacks and some alcohol aswell as a smokers lounge. The nicest feature however were the showers: really big clean and with lots of amenities.,4,0.5505193893044773
B Low,There is still a lack of shower facilities at both T and the newer T lounges for Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold Members (SATS lounge at T is no longer made available to SIA KFGold Members). As the toilet facilities are located just next to the lounges additional plumbing costs and showers fittings would be at a bare minimum to sat the least - a real disappointment when a shower during transit will be a refreshing welcome between two long haul flights. Singapore Airlines are dropping their standards across the board. A real pity for a once premium carrier.,3,-0.23261870920862976
J Chew,T Business Class Lounge - as usual the staff at the front desk grimaced at all the guests walking in. I was there during breakfast time and the food was dry overcooked. Would have been helpful if they had some fresh fruits - even some apples and bananas on a plate would be helpful. I had a quick bite walked out of the lounge with the customer service staff staring at me. I walk no more than  steps out of the lounge turn to go back in as I left my jacket and was stopped at the entrance with a very brusque demanding """"Boarding Pass please"""". Well at least she said please but honestly? If I did not live in Singapore I would never choose to take SQ as my first choice. Customer service is appalling unless you're a well dressed business man.""",3,-0.232618709
K Franklin,This lounge is disappointing and perhaps a reflection of how SIA views Star Alliance Gold fliers from other airlines - ie. poorly. The food service area is small with a limited selection of light meals. There are no toilets or showers in this lounge. So it is not a great place for a transit stop. In comparison the SATS lounge in T is a better lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Theresa Crause,Pathetic is the only word I can use to describe this lounge. I asked at the first class lounge why we were not allowed in there (facilities fabulous for first class). After complaining about the lack of warning for business class passengers about the lounge they would still not budge saying that we are unable to use the facilities besides the toilets which were located in the first class lounge (none in the business class lounge and quite far away!). Very disappointing. Like other reviewers it is unacceptable that SAA expect business class passengers to pay the full price but do not provide the full facilities.,1,-1.798894906
Stuart Walker,Very poor. At approximately am it was impossible to find a seat. Selection of food and drink minimal. No wireless and only two computers. No toilets. No telephones.,2,-1.015756808
Grahame Morris,I prefer the old brown leather seats in the T lounge in Singapore - far more comfortable than the newer seats in the T lounge - especially if you have a longish layover. I see they are going to renovate the T lounge - I hope that they retain the old leather lounge chairs. I hope if they ever renovate the Sydney lounge that the keep the older brown leather chairs.,4,0.550519389
D Clarkson,I would expect a lot more form Singapore Airlines. Sydney airport lounge is appalling considering the levels of service Singapore claim to offer their passengers. with  flights per day from Sydney - and at present two of these are A services. The size of the lounge the seating food and beverages all very average. I was very disappointed.,1,-1.798894906
Francis Wong,"Since my last review of this renovated lounge a year ago, improvement has been made. Staff are welcoming and courteous. Depending on the time of the day you visit, food plentiful and delicious. This is a lounge which offers good food, not just finger food or snacks, but a full dinner or lunch. They have a bar with wine, beers and other drinks. A quiet section for passengers who wish to catch a moment of rest. Wifi is free. Bathrooms and showers well maintained and staffed. The lounge has a great view of the runway.  It is for the use of business class passengers, and I believe maybe Oneworld emerald members too (not sure). Oneworld gold members use the Palm strip lounge. One complaint, the air-conditioning which is always too cold in there.",6,2.116795586
Kim Fitzgerald,A bit of a journey to find this. Every drink ordered had to be matched to invitation card which was a bit of a farce as they did not keep them in any order. Whilst the decor wasn't special the food and snacks on offer were very tasty. Restrooms nothing special.,2,-1.015756808
Michael Schade,The ultimate horror lounge. I was there during peak hour at pm. It was so crowded that most had to eat/drink standing. Drink and food choice was reasonable but the size does not match the demand.,3,-0.232618709
S Wijesinha,Outstanding SIA Business Class Lounge in T with many separate sitting areas including one for catching a nap on a sofa. Staff gave me a blanket and pillow and noted my seat number to ensure I didn't miss my flight! Wine and liquor selection somewhat limited. Food selection was excellent with prompt removal of used plates and filling empty food trays. The shower stalls aren't as good as a few competitors but other facilities in the restroom area are very good.,5,1.333657488
P Elliott,"Quite a few airlines use this lounge, but when we were there, lunch time, weekday, it was nearly empty. There were plenty different drinks to choose from. Serve yourself. Food was snack type, but eat as much as you want. A pleasant way to spend an hour or so whilst waiting for your flight.

P Browne,Used this lounge on th February . It has recently been refurbished and is spacious and has plenty of seating available. Food on offer at the time of our visit  to . was good with a choice of hot of cold meals. One good thing is that the hot meals are presented in small amounts so that they are kept fresh. Service was good and there was choice of drinks with champagne on unlimited supply if you wanted it. The only thing I found lacking was that there were no peanuts on offer. Toilet facilities are good and clean but I did not notice any shower facilities. Overall a vast improvement over the lounge used last year.,5,1.333657488
Peter O'Neil,Very quiet and beautifully lit made for a very relaxing wait. the dining and food was great the bathrooms in the first class lounge were stocked full of great toiletries and fluffy towels. overall quite impressive I thought especially after the dreadful st class lounge that they use in Terminal  at Dubai airport.,5,1.333657488
Michael Smolders,A small but well appointed lounge. Plenty of individual body hugging armchairs. A small but very tasty selection of foods including dim sum gourmet sandwiches cold meats yoghurt maggie beer ice cream nespresso coffee machine spirits and soft drinks. Bathrooms clean and well maintained. Staff very friendly and attentive. Free internet and wifi access. Great selection of newspapers and magazines.,4,0.550519389
A Johnstone,Compared to other SQ lounges I have used this was very disappointing. Very small - was awaiting SQ departure an A with a full Business Class cabin so there were few empty seats. Decided to leave and used the adjacent NZ lounge. Many times bigger better food selection and facilities.,3,-0.232618709
F Wong,I tried this newly renovated lounge at the same location of the previous one. It's very cold with excessive air conditioning. Staff greeted me warmly lounge offers good view of the runway and has a bar as well. Also some comfortable lounge chairs at the back if you want to relax and take a nap. A few computers were available for use to check emails etc. Free wifi in the lounge. However some problems in the toilet/shower it's showing signs of age despite it being a few months old. Strangely so many attendants inside the toilet (hunting for tips?). Door knob of a disabled toilet came off as I was closing the door also some wood chipped and cracked in the door! The luggage storage area is a joke it's stacked full of their junks wheel chairs and work papers. They still have miles to go before making this lounge a great one.,4,0.550519389
B Bamkin,You get what you pay for. We found a cheap business class ticket to Europe on Sri Lankan and are now in CMB for an  hr layover. We left the airport and have eaten at Negambo beach (which is worth it if you're wondering just a  min taxi ride away) and are now back in the lounge. Vinyl tub chairs a la  (and no it's not meant to be retro) small toilet area (staff will wait outside cubicle until you are finished) one shower and pretty average food. A nice chill out zone but it's small. Oneworld level of service/quality this lounge is not! All in all cheap airfare means this is what you get so I am grateful to be flying business on a bed and I guess lucky to be in a lounge.,3,-0.232618709
B Bamkin,UL uses the Dnata lounge in SIN terminal . The lounge is small and overlooks a void into the main terminal so squealing kids from below can be heard loud and clear. Food is OK drinks basic but plentiful staff very warms and welcoming good showers and bathrooms.,4,0.550519389
Savi Mull,Spacious lounge with clustered seating. Very quiet. Had a good selection of hot and cold dishes and an array of beverages including champagne! Chic look but missed recliner cushy sofas! The washrooms and showers were very clean and attended to! Vast array of newspaper and reading material. Could do with a spa to go with the cool look and good service! The biggest miss was the view of the tarmac!,5,1.333657488
Peter Schweizer,"One of the best lounges I have ever used. Very calm and relaxed ambience. Lots of high quality seating available. Great food and drink selection. Free wifi. Server was down at first but after pointing out the problems I was having logging on manager at the business centre made few calls and had the server re-booted. Empty dishes and tables cleaned frequently. Shower and restroom facilities spotless. Lounge would be perfect if they had a separate """"""""rest area"""""""" with lounge chairs and mobile phone restrictions.""""",5,"1.3336574878175844"""
Ted McDonald,There are two minor problems with this lounge: the lack of windows - in common with most of the international lounges at MEL - and the fact that like most of the Silver Kris lounges it is looking a bit dowdy and dated. The amount of space was ok food and drink selection was fairly good and the lounge was very clean.,4,0.550519389
Venkateswaran Thakku,Serendib lounge was quite difficult to identify though the facilities were pretty good. Lounge was clean with good food and beverages & WiFi with decent speed. A  minute complimentary massage is wonderful. Staff quite courteous and helpful. Washroom was mediocre. Overall I rate it slightly above average.,4,0.550519389
M Bertram,I was quite impressed with the clean and spacious Serendib lounge. We arrived very early in the morning so there weren't many other people around but even as other passengers trickled in it still didn't feel crowded. However there are only a few toilets and an attendant in there all of the time so it can feel a little cramped in the bathrooms. I liked the view airside and we were able to get seats right near the window (one of the advantages of arriving early I suppose). The food and beverage selection (especially the tea) was good. The staff make boarding announcements and will come around and tell you individually when your flight is boarding.,4,0.550519389
Ted McDonald,I agree with the other comments on here about the lack of toilets and showers - completely disgraceful. The lack of lockers for hand luggage is also irritating for a solo traveller as every time you want to get a drink or some food you have to haul all your things with you and potentially loose your seat. Having said that I found the service and atmosphere to be adequate and lounge felt relatively spacious. The food and drinks were fairly plentiful but a bit stodgy.,2,-1.015756808
Ravi Perera,The lounge is spacious and comfortable and was occupied by another passenger and myself flying on SQ to Singapore. We were informed that free massages were available but unfortunately there was no one available. There was a good selection of Eastern and Western food available for breakfast with a good selection of Sri Lanka tea as well. Toilets were extremely clean with an attendant checking it after each use. Great view of the east side apron and partial view of the runway. Good customer service with SQ ground staff accompanying you to the airbridge.,4,0.550519389
M Bertram,We didn't really like this lounge much as it was noisy crowded and some of the staff seemed a bit surly - though one of the staff clearing away plates and glasses was very friendly and we chatted with him for a while to pass the time. I think the best seats are near the windows but they were all taken when we arrived so we ended up with some seats in the back corner near the computers. The food was okay not delicious though selection of drinks quite good. The bathrooms were clean. We ended up leaving the lounge early to wander around the airport as we got bored of sitting and staring at the wall.,3,-0.232618709
B Rippingale,A good choice of foods at breakfast and meal time. There were a lot of staff working in the lounge. Front desk was not always occupied and had to wait several minutes on both visits. Staff were friendly and there was an extensive choice of drinks. Wifi and use of computers including a printer were very helpful. Lots of seats but no recliners which would have made the  hour wait more enjoyable. Shower facility very limited a shower is located with a toilet and there is only one shower - making it difficult to use as several people were waiting. There is also an indication of a rest room but if this was available it was never advertised. Unable to use lounge after departing flight and told to go to transfer desk to see about getting accommodation even though it states on some literature that you can use the lounge after departing the plane to freshen up. Even though we were transiting passengers and using Business for all flights we were told we could not use the lounge unless it was less than  hours before departure.,4,0.550519389
Daniel Haw,Definitely dated and was the smallest business/first class lounge I have used. We were there for breakfast just before our flight. Food selection was narrow. The toilets do need upgrading. Another inherent weakness is that they do not offer to look after your handluggage/trolleys whereas in the MAS Golden Lounge you are granted the use of lockers. We were told this was for security concerns,,
G Cassie,This expansive lounge with its phalanx of greeters the subdued blue-lit translucent columns at entry is as appealing as it is enormous. Huge number of seating options from pleasant views out to the departure gates to snug corners for a snooze. The usual CNN slash ESPN flat screen offerings. A large selection of food,,
S Miller,This was my first time in the SATS Star Gold Lounge at Singapore. It is big and has a reasonable selection of breakfast food (it was early am). The staff were very efficient and the lounge kept very clean. Not sure if WiFi was available but the lounge did have at least  commuter stations with web access. Unbelievably there are no toilets in the lounge. You have to go outside and use a public toilet. There are no showers either in what is a major Star hub this is unforgivable.,3,-0.232618709
B Rippingale,Good lounge with good selection of drinks and food Showers wifi and computers available. The lounge has a balcony overlooking main airport areas and this means it can be noisy. Well maintained and not many people using lounge.,4,0.550519389
Michael Schade,Nice large not too crowded lounge with decent food and drinks. Toilet and shower facilities not the best but a lot better than most European and US lounges.,4,0.550519389
Greg O'Brien,Agree totally with Mr Weiss (review  October). For a new home base lounge this is totally inadequate. At .am it was impossible to find a private seat. For the one cooking station there was a queue - it really did not matter as there was no table space for one to sit down and eat anyway. I cannot imagine why in a brand new terminal this should happen.,3,-0.232618709
Stephen Taynton,Generally a good lounge with good seating area mind you some lounge type seating would not go astray as we had a four hour layover and it would have been nice to stretch out. WiFi is good but at times very slow. Food okay but have seen better in other business lounges. Plenty of space and lots of seating so finding a good corner not a problem. The showers are especially welcoming and staff are very helpful. They should have a wider range of wine as they only had Reisling on offer. Generally not a bad lounge but I cannot understand why Singapore Airlines do not announce flight departures.,4,0.550519389
Ahmed Zuhairi,Food quality was rather poor. Aircon was not turned on so it was quite warm. Plenty of space as it was not busy. Plenty of computers and free wifi. Free  minute massage with an extra  minutes costing $. Shower and relaxing rooms available.,3,-0.232618709
Chris Parsons,Comfortable lounge with a good selection of local and western hot and cold food. Good selection of drinks including a cocktail of the month. Lounge and bathrooms clean.  quiet rooms in which to relax/sleep and the complimentary  minute massage - not to be missed! There is a dining area with a large TV and more relaxing area with coffee tables looking over the apron. There are six computers and also free wifi and the option to sign out an ipad for you stay in the lounge - also an option to use an Xbox in the lounge.

Jeremy Weiss,Disappointed in the fact that the lounge overlooks the departure gates and has no direct natural lighting. The atmosphere and decor are pleasant. The buffet with a chef preparing breakfast orders is nice but the restaurant seating area is clearly insufficient for the number of passengers. The same facility in the Business Class section appeared just as overtaxed. For smokers there is an outdoor terrace located immediately outside the lounge entrance.,2,-1.015756808

R Brook,Would have written about their lounge in Colombo but never could find it! However I can write about their lounge in KUL (KLIA). Rather than have a lounge of their own or sharing with one of the major airlines that have lounges there they send their business class to the horrible little lounge that anyone can buy a pass to. Crowded dirty a smoking area that can at best hold  people standing (and almost always packed) poor food. It was so bad that I went to the public area and paid for food and drink.,1,-1.798894906

Andrew Mackrill,"The La Vallette Club seems to be the only airline lounge at Malta airport and it covers all types of traffic. From paid memberships, through business class pax for various airlines and also I believe for Star Alliance Gold and I guess One World Gold pax too. Though there was some confusion over guest access for a member which is plus one for *G everywhere, at least that I'm aware of. They were happy to let the card holder in but had to consult the rule book for a companion. This took a while but all was OK in the end. Perhaps it was because Swiss was new to this airport, but then they have had other Star Alliance carriers for a time now. The lounge itself is a decent size but it's on the basis side when it comes to food and beverages. The white wine was especially poor. But lots of nice leather lounges to sit on, free and fast Wi-Fi, active TV news monitors, windows albeit to the landside of the terminal and a business centre with desktop computers and a printer. The lounge has dedicated bathrooms and a shower. The lounge guys were very pleasant and it was an easy place to wait it for a few hours during our flight delay.",6,2.116795586
Suhail Kazim,This lounge is apparently a new one opened by SIA. There is a long trek to it - too much of walking actually. The reception staff are warm and just welcome you but do not give much information of the lounge. The worst part is that the lounge does not have any toilets or showers! Something really unacceptable for a newly opened lounge in such a spic and span airport. Hot and cold food items are present and internet access is also free. Overall a good lounge but marred totally buy lack of toilets and its distant location.,3,-0.232618709
Michael Crossan,Overall a decent lounge. Plenty of seating good access to TV and internet as needed. Selection of food and drink limited though of a good standard. No shower facilities observed. Unfortunately the level of service provided was substandard. Firstly the initial greeting at the reception desk was sullen mechanical and cold on both occasions I entered the lounge. Secondly there was no lounge manager visible to oversee the generally running of the lounge. This was evident by food bowls remaining empty for significant periods of time as well as floor staff (especially the male staff members) who simply loitered around the drinks areas and whose behaviour was unprofessional bearing on juvenile.,3,-0.232618709

M LAYE,hours of transit in Colombo with access to Serendib Lounge in CMB airport. The lounge access is not really clear no indication just a small label on white doors. Its spacious with modern stuff for a biz lounge : hot meal shower  internet access and massage service to de stress from your flight. You have  rooms to sleep. The only negative point is that shower were used by a staff member when I tried to get inside. For passengers holding a Skywards Gold card or Silver and travelling on Economy UL has built a small corner separated from the noisy airport with small garden barriers and awful furniture. The buffet of this economy lounge consists in sandwichies and cakes with free drinks. You have also  internet access.,3,-0.232618709
M Walser,First impression: Two very unfriendly ladies at the reception. They refused to let me in as I had no invitation. I told them they I had checked in online but still: No. They sent me a transfer counter where they would issue me an invitation. But they said: No you can access lounge without invitation. So back to the lounge and finally without excuse they let me in. The lounge itself is dark no windows artificial lights dirty. The food supply is - how shall I call it - rather limited und looks disgusting. I only took a coke as it was in a sealed bottle. WLAN was okay. Very loud music was played. Restrooms outside the lounge. I left the that place rather quickly and spent the waiting time in the terminal. It must be one of the worst lounges I ever visited. Don't bother going there - shame on Swiss to offer such a hole to its passengers.,1,-1.798894906

Trond Tornes,Food offer not good - how about a simple healthy build-your-own salad. It wouldn't cost more than the food offered. Or offer food brought from one of the restaurants downstairs.

Apart from that this is a good calm and clean lounge.,3,-0.232618709
T Gubser,Very unfriendly staff they hardly greet you and do not want to help you even if you have a medical problem. When asked they told me to go to the Swiss counter they would not help as it is not their job - being a Gold Star Alliance member for many years I must say this is unacceptable. I would expect some more support. The food is bad no choice and the few things they have are without any taste. The lounge is always too crowded so it is hard to find a seat and there is a lot of used glasses and dishes around the staff is not fast enough to clean and maintain the lounge in a good way.,2,-1.015756808
D Ruckel,I used the lounge as an Avianca customer. I entered the lounge at  AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swiss logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional,,
J Lemon,We were flying on Lufthansa from Geneva to Frankfurt with an onward connection on Lufthansa in international business class to Dallas/Ft. Worth and were able to use the Swiss business class lounge. We arrived at the door to the lounge at :am only to find it was closed. However the hours of operation were posted and the lounge opened at :am. Once inside we found a clean and spacious facility that was virtually empty of passengers as it was a Saturday. Given the hour we passed on the rather well stocked bar featuring a number of different alcoholic beverages (beer wine and hard liquor but no champagne) and opted for coffee orange juice and croissant instead. The food offerings were a bit limited,,
T Gubser,Very disappointing lounge experience: old and outdated lounge old design with dark colours (very seventies style) not very comfortable seats. Food choice and quality far below average. Also wine selection and quality offered very bad. Service not very attentive. Very surprising as usually Singapore and other major Asian cities offers good quality but this lounge in Changi Terminal  is clearly a disappointment!,3,-0.232618709
Fabian Meier,Absolutely underwhelming.  hot foods which are mediocre and a few salads during meal times plus  sandwiches which are the best of the offerings which says it all. Drinks selection is acceptable but nothing more. Very crowded you won't get seats in the rush hours. Toilets are too small too showers are ok but not really nice (Arrival Lounge is very good in comparison). Internet needs a code which you can get by text service or at the reception.,2,-1.015756808
Robert Brice,For Swiss minimalism read scowling staff one choice of pasta soup straight out of a packet and that's it. Swiss lounges are probably the most basic I have visited with virtually no selection of food or drinks and staff who seen incapable of smiling.,2,-1.015756808
P Talbot,Very basic lounge no bubbles ready packed sandwiches limited alcoholic beverages. Old and tired decor. Needs a total revamp and not a pleasant experience. Staff could not be bothered. WiFi access intermittent.,1,-1.798894906
Peter Hoe,"I've been to this lounge twice in  months. Although large spacious and well lit it falls short of everything else. After flying in from Newark I requested to have a shower and was told abruptly that I have to wait. When I mentioned to the lady at the desk that the staff did not refill the shower & body lotion she gave no response. The food offered in this lounge can hardly be described as edible. The main course for lunch today is macaroni and potatoes! Pale yellow and totally unappetizing. Very little else is on offer. And they don't do "" smiles"" either. A little later when I enquire with the same lady if they had a day room she almost rolled her eyes! Swiss has failed badly in their effort to provide a Business Class lounge that could warrant any star rating.",1,-1.798894906
R Deu, This lounge was refurbished about  years ago when it became Senator lounge. The staff is far from being helpful and you do not feel welcome at all. The selection of food and drink has been the same from the re-opening. I will never understand that no food available from am -  pm and from - h. Only hard dry sweets peanuts and that's it. The selection of newspapers downgraded each month. Waiters are very noisy joking ans shouting in the kitchen. Hot meal also the same for ages,,
S Kazim,Swiss should be ashamed of their flagship lounge. First of all the location is a bit weird specially for those traveling international. The lounge is accessed after security but before immigration so you need to leave well in advance if your gate is in the E area. Staff are not welcoming and the bar staff are surly and rude and find it cumbersome to make a drink for you. Food is limited with  rice and some cold unappetizing sandwiches. Sadly enough of none of the cheese or chocolates which this beautiful country is famous for are seen in the lounge.,2,-1.015756808
B Tesanovic,Small lounge with limited food and drinks and by far the unfriendliest attendants from any lounges I've experienced. This lounge has only got one shower be prepared for really long wait for a shower. Luckily I do have few hours between the flights. When I asked about wi fi the answer was 'it is all written here'. Why work in service industry if you can't be bothered to provide service!,3,-0.232618709
R Winger,Swiss provides lounge service for all Star Alliance carriers at JFK T. Its probably the skimpiest lounge I have ever encountered anywhere. Catering in the morning is limited to some berries and some stale bagels. The cappuccino button on the coffee machine is disabled (saving milk?). There are no newspapers. The only thing there is are armchairs at least  years old and uncomfortable. I mostly use the lounge before the Avianca flight to Bogota in the morning and I thought that Avianca is the poor cousin in the Star Alliance and its passengers get correspondingly offhanded treatment. Not so. A couple of months ago I took Swiss First to Zurich and used the F section of the lounge. Indistinguishable except for a simmering pot of unidentifiable meat and half a bottle of champagne. Isn't Swiss service supposed to be something special?,3,-0.232618709
K Pahkim,In transit and we first stopped in at Swiss Lounge D. nice comfortable facility but only one shower available. As we had a long layover the agent recommended we head over to the Arrivals Lounge just past customs. Clean classy and functional. The showers were a great size with clothes pressing relaxation zone and good breakfast variety. You feel more than refreshed leaving here. The one annoying thing is that the internet is limited to  minutes free.,5,1.333657488
K Pahkim,Out of  lounge visits in a two week trip this was one of the smartest ones we experienced. there are two showers that were more than spacious and well kept for use. The food choices were a hot buffet with  items (Thai Chicken curry stroganoff stir fry etc) and a full fridge of sandwiches sushi and fruit and yogurt as well as soup and self serve liquor coffee and drinks. Each zone allowed you to be private and work and the TVs were at a low volume so as not to disturb. The internet was a little slow and depending on where you sat would lose connectivity. Definitely worth seeking out and less crowded than the Bidvest and SAA Baobab Lounges that we also stopped in at.,5,1.333657488
A Leger,I am an occasional visitor of the Geneva SWISS Senator lounge and my Friday evening visit (th January ) was my worst experience here. The lounge was very crowded and food trays were empty - the only food available was pretzels peanuts and candy. I waited for the lounge staff to replenish the food trays but they only brought out cake. Not this lounge's finest hour.,3,-0.232618709
M Aspinall,This Star Alliance Lounge in LAX could be the worst First Class International Lounge in the US. First - it is ugly no life and for the next year no natural light due to airport construction. The seats are large but arranged in a train format -  by  and then  rows back. If you want to see the TV - almost impossible beyond row . Today - the seats were filthy - dry food on the first three seats that I sat on. The food is meagre and uninteresting. Some sushi - but overly cold and poor quality. Sandwiches are clearly made only once a day in the morning. Desserts not bad. The worst part is the staff - unpleasant and unresponsive at best. When I asked for the TV channels to be changed the front desk staff said that it would take  minutes - because that they needed a supervisor to do it. When I then asked one of the food clearing staff she changed the channels immediately. The staff at the desk tals so loudly that twice I had to ask them to quiet down so I could conduct a phone call on my mobile.,2,-1.015756808
Ernst Maegli,High expectations on Senator Lounge on my first visit as Gold pax. Unfortunately in Zurich the Senator (Gold) Lounge has less space available then Business Class lounge at least at some hours. Walking around till someone leaves. Worse than nd class waiting rooms at train stations. In the meantime I learned to change to Business Class lounge (just more seats and more possibilities to find a quiet corner). Food about the same (extra sandwiches) and drinks also not too spectacular. Staff (waiters) the same as in Business lounge not very interested in the customer very loud speaking among each other and handling plates/glasses. A disappointment if you're hoping for a higher level of service.,3,-0.232618709
Mauricio Canosa,I had high expectations on this lounge and I can say my experience was not the best. I arrived around pm during a busy evening at Zurich Airport. Beautiful reception area and an elegant restaurant sided by a long bar which was almost full of passengers having dinner. Another room with large leather sofas sided by a buffet and bar. Windows with great views of aircraft. I opted for the buffet. Great choices of appetizers cheeses and breads all of high quality. Also great range of wines and spirits. Soon the lounge became crowded - used plates and glasses quickly filled the cocktail tables and buffet space. When I went to choose one of the hot entrees all of them had finished with no replacements. It is a well appointed lounge but service should be improved.,3,-0.232618709
Mary Klestadt,The new Swiss arrivals lounge at Zurich is really excellent - particularly after a long-haul flight from Hong Kong. Located near the exit from Arrivals hall  (near customs) it has well-staffed showers (!) that are very spacious and well-supplied and they also offer a  minute ironing service. The lounge area itself was large and at am-am - the time I was there - the breakfast selection was excellent and regularly replenished. An ideal place to refresh while you wait for businesses or shops in Zurich to open!,5,1.333657488
R Mortara,One of the several options open to Swiss passengers this one is located towards the north end of the main terminal on the upper level. Its clean and comfortable and peaceful. Good selection of drinks and during the morning a variety of breakfast food is available. Alas on the day I came back the only hot food provided was curry soup or Indian style rice (neither an option for me on my diet). Papers and magazines appear to be limited to german language editions although the FT was available in the afternoon.,3,-0.232618709
N Werner,The new lounge in the recently opened Terminal B/D (non-Schengen) for flights to London etc. looks modern nice and has nice views of the tarmac but that is where the praise ends. Staff is typically LX being cold and not overly friendly. Food selection is a disgrace. One hot dish soup and bread with some fruits. Not really what one would expect from such a good airline. Drinks selection is ok and you get  hours of free WiFi with a voucher. Toilets are outside and the lounge is hidden in the far end of the corner. Staff in the kitchen is quite loud at times which means it is not that relaxing. There is also only one screen to check the status of your flight and it is not conveniently located. Swiss can do better than this.,3,-0.232618709
Michel Jeff,This is probably the best SWISS lounge (also doubles as Star Alliance Lounge). Amazing views of the runways from this circular lounge with surprisingly tasty hot food good selection of drinks and above all a very calm and relaxing atmosphere - even to the extent of having laid back chairs/beds to watch the planes take off and land. Free high speed WIFI. Worth choosing Basel to fly from if convenient compared to Geneva or Zurich just for the excellent lounge. SWISS do some things well (not all by a long stretch) - and this is definitely one of them!,5,1.333657488
Robert Brice,A brand new but typically Swiss lounge: cold staff no atmosphere very poor selection of food (rice apples and bread rolls) and a limited selection of drinks. Internet access is not free and costs a staggering  francs (+ euros)! Very poor when compared to every other major airline.,2,-1.015756808
Mark Barber,Staffed by moody unsmiling staff who fail to recognize that customer service is part of their job. The food choice is particularly poor - the usual cheese pasta (a staple in all Swiss lounges) and dried out sandwiches. Overcrowded and chaotic - on a par with Lufthansa.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Sorger,"TAM do not use Oneworld lounge at Frankfurt Airport since it operates on Lufthansa Terminal. In the past Senator and Business Class Lounges from Lufthansa were offered but it looks like the TAM Airlines need to cut down costs so they have changed to Air Canada Lounge.""",5,1.333657488
R Krusenstjerna,I regularly use this lounge when transferring at Zurich. There is a good choice of seating. There are plenty of newspapers also foreign ones. Although a non-smoker the smokers' bar ie. the upstairs area with the serviced bar is my favourite spot. Best view nice light conditions very friendly bar staff and good choice of drinks. The choice of beverages in the self-service areas is very good. I love the Rivella a Swiss lemonade which is milk-acid based and very rejuvenating. The problems of this lounge are the lack of good food especially hot food items if any at all are very poor standard. Another problem are the loud service staff which sometimes make it hard to relax and refresh in this lounge.,4,0.550519389
Chris Antipodes,Very disappointing. The lady at reception was unsmiling and made you feel like you were keeping her from more important work. The lounge itself is adequate but it was entirely unacceptable that no hot food was available an hour before closing only old stale sandwiches. It's strange that the toilets are outside. The view was nice but the Swiss business lounge in terminal A is far better overall.,2,-1.015756808
N Werner,Flew with TG and they use the Panorama lounge or Swiss lounge in Zurich. As we first wanted to use the Swiss lounge they told us that we can only use one lounge and if we used the Swiss lounge we could no longer use the Panorama lounge. I found this policy to be confusing and insulting if you have a business class ticket. So we decided to go to the Panorama lounge as it was closer to the gate but took around  minutes to get there first. Once in the lounge the food selection was ok and the drink selection was fine too. The views are magnificent and the lounge was not crowded even though TG SQ BA LX AC etc. all use this lounge. In comparison to other lounges worldwide it is average/below par. Internet is not free.,3,-0.232618709
P Laville,Apart from its new location no effort has been made from previous locations regarding catering. The snacks quite often are stale with cheap cold cuts and poor quality cheeses. A mediocre service quite in tune with the TAM overall performance.,2,-1.015756808
F Burgos,The lounge is a dark affair without any natural light and deficient artificial lighting. Very poor layout in a meandering way. Food is very basic and drinks acceptable. WiFi was adequate with an access code. The lounge is used by several airlines and tends to get crowded. One of the poorer lounge experiences.,3,-0.232618709
Pierre Laville,In what is supposed to be the biggest airport in Latin America LATAM is providing a crowded place with poor seating availability miserable food offerings where dough seems to be the basic ingredient. Do not dare looking for plugs either. Better show up with a fully charged laptop.,2,-1.015756808
S Lima,An awful experience. Staff not friendly. There were a miserable small plastic dishes on top of the bar with three pieces of sandwiches. The food selection doesn't exist. The drink selection is poor. Very old structure. Not recommended.,2,-1.015756808
S Lima,Staff was friendly and efficient there were three computers with internet. Seating comfortable and spacious food selection good in comparison to other lounges. The drinks selection was very good.,4,0.550519389
Chris Joynes,Tacky uncomfortable Lounge. Toy-town furniture. No privacy even from the corridors outside as some walls are only glass. Food judging by my numerous visits over the past few years is usually a bowl of tasteless puff pastry discs which often runs out before pm. Drinks reasonable. In short the lounge is almost completely neglected and permanently dirty. No information nor flights called as staff are too busy communicating with their friends. Toilets outside lounge. Wi-Fi sometimes sporadic and temperamental but always very slow. The airport should provide better both in quality of lounge and staff. Not under SWISS direct control of course but I feel they should insist on a better product than this.,2,-1.015756808
M Duke,A very crowded place. Very warm. People sitting on the floor as no seats available. Left the lounge early to find somewhere to sit! Boarded plane early so we could sit down.,2,-1.015756808
Mauricio Canosa,Departing on Lufthansa First Class to Europe I visited the TAM lounges. The newly opened Business Class Lounge on Terminal . A big one with many sofas and family room computer stations self-service bar etc. It looked new and had views of the apron but I found it kind of tacky. Its buffet had a coffee machine plus petit-fours and cakes wines and other drinks. I asked the receptionist about the First Class lounge she said it was a  minutes walk to Terminal . So I moved and found it closed! I went to the opposite door the TAM Business Lounge and was invited to wait there as their First one would open soon. This is an older and smaller lounge it was very crowded and was even hard to find a place to sit. Noisy and dark but it was well-decorated. The buffet was ok with some wraps and wines/beers choices. Soon the receptionist came to me and said I could move to their First Class lounge. Small but decorated in good taste piano in the entrance leather sofas but no apron or outside views. The room looked exclusive and private. The menu had great choices as Lobsters Carpaccio salads etc. A great wines and spirits list.,4,0.550519389
M Schechter,A disappointing lounge in one of the worst international airport terminals (Terminal  at GIG). Rubbery plastic-wrapped food small selection of drinks awfully slow complimentary wi-fi provided via a scratch card and limited to  hours. Furniture and decor are standard airport lounge fare. Bathroom had broken fixtures. The place is basically unstaffed.,2,-1.015756808
Chris Joynes,"Reasonable Lounge but not up to the standard of the Senator Lounge in ZRH. Pleasant and helpful desk staff. Service staff do not seem to want to replenish the stocks in a timely manner. Drinks but especially food run out quite often. Cleanliness does not seem to be top of the list either. White wine & Prosecco never kept cold. A dozen ice cubes will not do much for two or three bottles and cannot be expected to last for  hours! PC's now work since being replaced. Wi-Fi is available if a slightly complicated phone-back system is followed and the provider actually phones back. Lounge ambience is not too bad although not really relaxing as the lounge is usually quite full. Access is via an escalator up but only stairs back down to departure gates. Toilets are outside and quite a way from the lounge too far considering the Senator Lounge is supposed to be a ""prestige"" product.",3,-0.232618709
O Sodergren,Ugly lounge with poor seating comfort poor internet services no good snacks or dishes. Even worse the personnel is very noisy (shouting laughing making lots of noise with empty glasses and bottles). Completely impossible to relax in that environment. Will definitely avoid ZRH for transfer in the future.,2,-1.015756808

Margaret Jones,Lounge small and very busy people were sitting on the floor as there were no seats. Internet access good. Food dreadful. Limited quantity and what was available was awful. No cups or glasses available. Wine good but appears soft drinks were only limited to local brands perhaps due to the high volume of passengers in the lounge at any one time. Receptionist very pleasant but catering staff very sullen. I left very promptly after writing this review. Colleagues who have also passed through this lounge have had a similar experience.,2,-1.015756808
Jonathan McMillan,I quite enjoyed the lounge - only negative is that it can get overcrowded. But since my flight was a later one pax from other flights left early. I had a nice shower and enjoyed the toiletries. The food is in reasonable - tasty snacks and cakes. Drinks are good and wine is served if asked. Quite enjoyed the live music played by the pianist which always set a soothing mood. Internet is good and wi-fi password is given as you enter the lounge by receptionist.,4,0.550519389

Dang Pham,Very clean and well decorated. Welcome personnel is nice but limited to one. Internet stations work well and fast. Coffee machine is up to the state of the art. Alcohol drink choice is small. Snacks cheeses breakfast breads and croissants are plenty and healthy choices too. Fresh fruits also available. Only no hot choice is offer.,4,0.550519389
Chris Joynes,Pathetic. Choice of a only a handful of drinks. Internet was not free credit card system in place. No food. Staff spent most of their time on loud bphone calls. Seats/tables not particularly clean. Toilets reasonable. SWISS should provide better.,2,-1.015756808
M Rapp,Small but nice place as long as it not crowded. Choice of newspapers/magazines as well as snacks is limited. Surprisingly there was beer and hard liquor but no wine available. Internet computers are available for free. Nice and welcoming staff. Shower was great with lots of towels and toiletries.,3,-0.232618709
A Hetier,I concur with the former comment. Either they didn't refurbish the Amex lounge or no result was visible. Clean but empty. Just a place to seat a rest room and nothing to eat. No internet connexion. I went out.,1,-1.798894906
A Hetier,This is a lounge that could improve. A choice of drinks comfortable seats but little food and an internet connection that comes and goes. But the staff are nice and announcements are made timely. The location of the lounge itself (near the gates) is convenient but the gates location are not (you have to walk across the entire terminal and to use stairs so if you have any duty-free shopping to do you should plan to do it before going to the lounge).,3,-0.232618709
Chris Joynes,Staff excellent. Clean toilet / shower facilities. Nice view from upper floor. Free Internet. Reasonable food selection and good drink selection. One minute from security checks to gates. Much quieter than Zurich. Bar seating cafÃ©-style seating leather armchair and relaxer seating upstairs.,4,0.550519389
A Hargrove,A very poor lounge on all fronts,,
R Ganbich,Swiss use the Millenium lounge - quite a pleasant experience. Staff was friendly and efficient there were two or three computers with internet but no wifi. Seating quite comfortable and generous. The food selection was very good in comparison to other lounges : fresh healthy things like crudites goat cheese savoury and sweet pastry sandwiches. The drinks selection was equally impressive. Despite most areas were naturally lit the disadvantage was perhaps the lack of any view towards the outside.,4,0.550519389
A Hetier,Like everything in Guarulhos airport TAM's lounge is too small. Signalling is poor: the lounge is located on the second floor (turn left just after passport control before entering the duty free shop). But generally you will find a place to seat in one of the three rooms. The selection of snacks is not wide but fresh and they can fix you a caipirinha if you ask for it. It has a shower (what a blessing!) and if you use it they will give you a nice selection of L'Occitane toiletries. The Wi-Fi works well. Sometimes a musician plays the piano. Announcements are made timely. Staff are helpful and proficient in English sometimes in Spanish.,4,0.550519389
J Agis,The lounge is nice but what is strange is that the offerings between the adjacent business class lounge and the supposedly higher Senator lounge is not that different. The bar selection is identical. Senator offered a few more snacks and a pasta with spinach dish. Business had a curry dish. Both were very good. The Senator lounge has two levels and there is no elevator to the second floor. So you need to ask one of the attendants to open the door if you want to use the elevator which is in the Business lounge. The seating is modern and good.,4,0.550519389
J Michel,Very nice lounge great views across the runways and good selection of drinks (including different champagnes) and hot food with a restaurant section. Pleasant showers to freshen up and a leather seated limo service to take you to the E Terminal for the long haul flights. Staff the usual Swiss efficient but seemed friendly and were very helpful.,4,0.550519389
C Cotton,In the old days of Swiss Air there were no lounge facilities at Rome Fiumincino. Today the use a lounge on pier E opposite gate  which is run by Alitalia staff. To enter you need to use the lift and go down a floor. This means the lounge has no windows. On entering there were  receptionists. Non of them were interested in serving me they were too busy on their mobiles. I stood like an idiot for  minutes for one of them to say hello. The lounge is not a nice haven. It has old large photo's on the back wall of Rome. It has a bar area toilets and that is just about it. There were no newspapers or magazines. The bar was stocked with basic drinks and beer on tap. The food was terrible curled up sandwiches where you had to search out the filling. The bar attendant was always in the back talking to someone else. I stood for  minutes waiting for him to come back to the bar. You could hear him but not see him. The WiFi cost  euros per hour which I did not use. There was simply no saving graces to this lounge. This has to be the worst lounge I have EVER used but given the fact that it is run by Alitalia is it any surprise it is so bad. Swiss needs to think about using this lounge it really is bad.,1,-1.798894906
Michael Kiepert,It is actually the old First Class lounge remodelled and in atmosphere it beats the old lounge. Quite comfortable leather chairs good lighting and new stone walls in beige make nice surroundings. Food and drink selection as in the previous business class lounge. Already quite a lot of people (on Friday evening and Tuesday morning) but all in all a nice place to spend some time.,2,-1.015756808
Ender Ozsezen,Newly opened lounge. Plenty of sitting area good choice of food drinks and snacks. Separate area for dining serving mostly pre-flight dining for night flights.

Paul Petrakakis,Zurich Swiss First lounge is a separate area within the Swiss Business lounge with a separate reception and service desk. The reception will identify eligibility for car transfer to US bound longhaul gate at the midfield terminal and arrange it with the visiting passenger-a very nice service indeed. Comfortable leather seating. Extensive self service bar extensive soft drinks. Hot drinks machine. Moderate assortment of hot food buffet including soup. Good selection of cold snacks. Swiss style hard cookies. One compact shower for First with access to the several similar Business Class section showers. Access to the Long Bar it is part of the Business Class section and connected to First by stair and a door or exit First section to Business and take the elevator- it faces the tarmac and is a nice feature. One or two computers for use not sure of WiFi. Quiet and relaxing atmosphere Swiss staff efficiency.,4,0.550519389
Dajo DeCourcy,This lounge is too small. It is always full and difficult to find seating. They have a good selection of magazines if you speak Portuguese. Having just spent an hour in the lounge the coffee spilt on the steps was not cleaned. There were no hors d'oeuvres Pepsi and Pepsi light taps were only pouring water there were no small bottles of water and practically every single table was dirty with dirty dishes - yet there were four people in the lounge kitchen. Apparently all too busy having a morning conversation rather than doing their job and making the lounge presentable.,2,-1.015756808

M Maly,The lounge is very difficult to find as there are no signs to navigate passengers to the Lounge. I arrived from non-Schengen flight and was transported by bus to the gate and as my flight was to non- Schengen country I passed the security check and entered the terminal where I tried to find the Business Lounge. After some minutes of walking and finding nothing I asked the staff at one of the gates to guide me to the Business Lounge. I had to go back to the Schengen terminal pass the passport control and security check. In the Schengen terminal no signs navigating to the Business Lounge. When I finally managed to find it it was about the time to go back to non-Schengen terminal again through the passport control. The only advantage was that I spent  minutes walking which was healthy exercise between  flights. I had a little chance to use the Business Lounge but the first impression was a strange light and very small space but a good selection of refreshment but no time to enjoy.,3,-0.232618709
R Deu,"Very nice airport and efficient public transportation. Staff is helpful and friendly. However the lounge is terrible. It is difficult to find but has nice views over the boarding areas.

Coffee is another joke a coffee machine which pours ""black water"" has nothing to do with nice portuguese coffee.",2,-1.015756808
R Deu,I like this quirky lounge. The staff is young and polite and willing to help. They sometimes take care of my carry-on which I can leave for some hours while in town. I can understand some people do not like the atmosphere. Pasteis de Nata and other salt pasteos are to die for. All the food is pretty much the same bit is replenished regularly. Wifi and PC work fine. My concern is that it is very cold. You need a blanket in the summer as they keep it below  degrees.,4,0.550519389

Peter Galliger,"I have been using this lounge for  years now and it keeps going downhill. The furniture is the same as it was when the lounge opened. There has been no upkeep. The food is very average. A few hot snacks like dim sum, and cold tiny sandwiches. There was one juice with no sugar, apple juice. no alcohol or beer. In the toilets the handle is broken off and the door is scratched and in poor condition. I will just stop using the lounge and wait at the gate from now on or go to a restaurant. It is somewhat depressing in there.",3,-0.232618709
Hazell Christy,The staff were very professional and accommodating however the food and the items on offer were largely unappetizing. The lounge was clean but the facilities were quite crowded because of the sheer number of airlines who use the lounge with Thai.,3,-0.232618709
M Lystad,We were lucky to get there early (around pm) so we got the good seats. After about one hour the lounge was overcrowded. It felt like sitting at the gate with kids running and screaming and lots of people standing waiting for available seats. The food is not impressive at all. The drinks is low average (beer coke and waters). Its a bar at the opposite end with - wines and some drinks. Wifi works well. Staff is good and trying to accommodate. The restrooms are OK. Across the hallway (concourse D) is the Spa. This is very nice and quiet - great free foot massage / neck massage for business class (more options for first). In all fairness I believe this lounge would be a lot better to visit morning or mid day when less people. Overall it is better at the lounge than outside so I will recommend it.,3,-0.232618709
C Fox,Used this lounge as a Qatar Airways customer - Thai Airways seems to be having serious financial issues and the quality of their lounges in Bangkok have gone down tremendously over the past two years. In this instance the lounge was grossly overcrowded with many airlines passengers. There were literally no seats available when I entered and I am writing this review standing up hoping for a seat. The beverage selection was average and the food selection well below average. The staff tried to help and were cheerful but were facing a much bigger crowd than the lounge was designed to handle or than the number of personnel could handle. Because of the big crowd the lounge bathrooms were rarely available and the general cleanliness was not good. I assume this is all a reflection of Thai Airways trying to rent out as many seats as possible in their lounge but I will not fly Qatar from Bangkok if the lounge situation does not improve.,2,-1.015756808
Thorkild Lykke,"Nice and spacious. On a Friday noon we were at no time more than - travellers in the lounge. The selection of food changes at  am from breakfast to lunch setting. The presentation was nice and the quality was ok. The champagne was very ""brut"". Considering that CDG is no home base for any Star Alliance airline it is a nice and comfortable lounge to wait in and even with a limited view to the runways.",4,0.550519389
C Fox,Visited the lounge in Concourse E as I had a  hour transit between flights. The lounge does not have a lot of space as there are many seats in a relatively small area compared to some other lounges. however some different hot dinner offerings were available as well as plenty of alcohol to help yourself to. So overall I was quite happy with the lounge even though it seemed a bit small with many flights departing over the time I was there everyone seemed to be able to get a seat. I also used the shower facilities which were excellent and a great way to freshen up prior to the flight.,5,1.333657488
Lyndon Maffey,Marginally better than sitting in the airport at the gate. Pretty average but at least I had a shower. Thai seems to be  years behind the times with aircraft on key routes and the lounge experience confirmed.,2,-1.015756808
Eddie Weiy,Basic Sleeping beds available in lounge. It was unfortunate that the staff members were quite noisy and they shouted occasionally. They were quite inconsiderate.,3,-0.232618709
Enrico Soresini,The worst Business Lounge I have been in recent years. Food offer is negligible basically non existant wine is not on offer espresso machine better buy one outside - very bad experience indeed. Why TG has got such a low class Lounge?,2,-1.015756808
Charles Sirapandji,Lounge is spacious and nice ambient staff is very friendly and helpful. But best of all the royal massage spa which really different and genuine Thai super service. Bar could be improved further from existing one.,4,0.550519389
G Harrison,Recently upgraded so the furnishings and carpets are new. The Business and First Class lounge reception desk is right outside the First Class lounge door so there is constant noise coming from the reception desk into the lounge . The hot food on offer looks awful and would be best avoided. There are no showers in the lounge and the drinks refrigerator needs repairing. The only upside to this lounge is that it is not as crowded as the Business lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Helge Holst,A very crowded lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport. The seats are okay specially the new ones by the entrance. They only serve snacks like spring rolls small pies etc. and sandwiches. They serve whisky gin cognac etc but no wine at all! We asked for red wine and one of the ladies working there came up with red Martini fantastic! You are forced to drink heavy liquor in stead of wine. I think it is the only lounge I have been to which has this very bad policy. They used to have wine and even cocktails but they have changed. We love Thai Airways but not their lounge at Bkk Airport! I really hope we will be able to get wine again.,3,-0.232618709
Carl Schelfhaut,Disappointing experience yet again. I do not understand why this lounge is so poor in choice of snacks and beverages for Thai's premium passengers. It used to be top line now it's below mediocre. I'm switching back to Singapore Airlines for my monthly travels to and from Bangkok. With SQ I get much more value for a slightly higher price all the way including on the ground.,2,-1.015756808
P Leelamanit,"I used this lounge from flying with Qatar Airways Business class. This lounge is getting worse every time I visit. Despite consistent service at the reception and cleaning after customers the food and drink selection is smaller and worse. The microwave heated puffs and dim-sums are now ""not quite there"". They are left empty for at least  mins until I asked a staff what was wrong. Occasionally the staff would have a table full of instant ramen noodles. Making me wonder now if this was a true business class lounge or a ""free-for-all customers"" lounge provided by another neighboring airline. Most seats are still grouped in . Making it appear more crowded almost automatically.",3,-0.232618709
Tony Hank,Sitting in the lounge at the moment. This is one of the best if not the best lounge I have been to. In particular the service is exceptional.,5,1.333657488
H Blumenthal,TG in its hub goes on with a terrible lounge that has been there for a long time. The airport is very modern but the lounge is run down with old and uncomfortable seats. Food and drinks very basic,,
David Jenkins,Royal First Lounge prior to taking night flight with Thai to LHR. As usual the staff are plentiful friendly and efficient. I have only two negative points about this lounge. The first is the design fault which allows all the noise of the concourse into the lounge as the plate glass windows have large areas open to the main terminal area. This is particularly noticeable in the private sitting rooms. The second also relates to those sitting rooms. Although comfortable they have one draw back. It is very difficult to get the attention of staff without getting up and going to the corridor which runs along the front of the row of sitting rooms. Staff are always passing by but never glance into the rooms. This problem could be easily solved by adding a call button which switched a light outside the room. Possibly too it is time to at least clean if not replace some of the carpets in the sitting rooms.,5,1.333657488
J Moore,Guest of Swiss as they utilise this Lounge as a Star Alliance member. Crowded due to the number of member flights departing in the - period with seating difficult to find. Within the lounge only beer and soft drinks plus tea and coffee can be self served eventually the bar was located but in the odd location at the bottom of the escalators leading to the lounges (first and business) and before reception. Drinks are dispensed by a bar tender - two staff coping with a packed lounge. To top it off there wasn't a choice of white wine variety there wasn't any white wine at all! For a nation's flag ship carrier which has about five lounges at this airport to have no white wine is astounding and reflects poorly on Swiss which has no say in the matter.,3,-0.232618709
M Vickery,Found the lounge relaxing with plenty of cold hot snacks available alcohol beer wine and soft drinks available. Spent  hours in this lounge with a call at Royal Orchid lounge for a massage. Only complaint is the long walk from one end to the other for the use of the bar. Lounge was quiet so no problems.,4,0.550519389
Mark Wilkins,The big let down with the Thai business class lounges is the quality of food they offer. This time I had a pleasant surprise in that they had some very tasty chicken tikka in the hot selection but the rest was the usual poor quality sandwiches hot dog rolls and restricted fruit selection. They also scrimp on some of the drink choices too - especially gin and lack of any wine. As a frequent flyer its a better than average lounge but if paying full business class fare I would not be impressed.,3,-0.232618709
Tim Nah,My second visit to the lounge in  months. No improvement in the quality and choices of food and drinks. The food was unpalatable with such limited choices the lounge placed cup noodles as their best item on offer. As a Singaporean I am well aware that good quality food and drinks are very reasonably priced in this country so why does Thai Airways stinge on this I wonder. The seats are fine and the lounge is quiet. No showers or even toilets available you'll have to use the public toilets outside the lounge. Skip the lounge and head to the restaurants for better food.,3,-0.232618709
O Johansen,The main business class lounge THAI offer their Royal Silk passengers is a worn out place. The seats shows that they are very old and despite the free internet its hardly a place to charge the battery of your computer. I use this lounge many times a year but I am surprised every time I enter the doors. There are two other lounges available however despite the fact that they are newer and cleaner the relatively small lounges are often overcrowded.,3,-0.232618709
Saketh Ram,Spent  hours in this lounge at midnight with about  wide-bodied flights departing (including Star alliance partners). The lounge was packed full not one seat available. It had clearly been used for hours with dirt and crumbs everywhere. The food was okay at best a couple sandwich selections and some sweets but nothing special. Staff were courteous but don't give out internet password unless you ask for it (after you sit down and get situated its annoying to have to get up and ask). This is supposed to be their flagship lounge and airport- not impressed.,3,-0.232618709
Ronald Kim,The lounge was quite clean and calm even though it shared with other Star Alliance customers. Food and Beverage selection was not bad. Plus the view from the lounge was superb.,3,-0.232618709
Ron Kuhlmann,The service is excellent the food offerings can be selected from an iPad listing and if you wish they book you for a massage in the Royal Spa. There was no aspect of the experience that I could imagine improving and the experience was like no other I have had.,5,1.333657488
A Anturkar,In Mumbai Thai Airways does not have its exclusive lounge. It shares its lounge with certain other Star Alliance Airlines. Celebrations lounge is not half as good as other lounges I have had the opportunity to be in around the world. It's like a  star hotel lobby. There's only one bathroom. The amenities are minimal. The food is nothing to be proud of either. But the courteous staff get full marks.,3,-0.232618709
A Matic,The worst international lounge I've ever encountered. A small yellow room overstuffed with chairs no tables a waiting room the size of a large living room. Food is questionable and limited alcohol is basic. I can't believe you pay business or first class air fares to receive this perk.,2,-1.015756808
H Y Kim,Excellent lounge but compared with their lounge in BKK it has little less facilities. (Shower other service). But food and view is absolutely better than other airline lounges in HKG.,4,0.550519389
P Leelamanit,I've used this lounge fairly often I gradually seeing improvements to the rock-hard seats. Cuisines have now been added to most seats. Unfortunately in terms of the snack and drink options this lounge fares worse than a lot of other airlines. For some very odd reasons there is no alcoholic beverages offered. In addition to this light snacks such as nuts crisps or crackers are nowhere to be found. Wi-Fi doesn't seem to work due to the capacity has been reached. I would say for today's airlines standard this lounge is really sub-par.,3,-0.232618709
John Duffus,I spent a dismal  minutes prior to an  departure in this extremely poor business class lounge. Apart from the complimentary drinks almost everything about the lounge is dreadful in the late evening hours when many medium- and long-haul flights are departing. Finding a seat is difficult the seats themselves are small and uncomfortable the snack-type food on offer is decades behind what other legacy carriers now offer at this time of day and the reading material is limited. Next time I shall just pay to spend the time at one of the public restaurants!,2,-1.015756808
S Strasser,The service and staff are great but unfortunately there is no quiet place. Even the private rooms (with no door) are open to the public terminal at the back side with all the announcements in full volume. This Lounge is no place to rest.,4,0.550519389
Christopher Oxley,The Thai Airways lounge in Manila Terminal  (MNL) is the worst lounge ever. It is tiny and everyone sits shoulder to shoulder in very small chairs. There is not enough seating to accommodate all business class customers. There are only a few coffee tables so you must hold your plate and drinks on your lap. Very few outlets to charge devices. This lounge is a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
R Gonzaga,Flying MH to KL so given access to TG lounge E. The lounge was dark and looked tired. Staff were efficient and pleasant enough and worked efficiently to clear plates and glasses. The food on offer was very disappointing. A few sandwiches prawn nuggets(!) dim sum dumplings vegetable pies a few miserable dry pastries and some fruit. This is Thailand so where was the Thai food? They had a god selection of liquor but no wine on offer. Wi-fi was good and there was sufficient reading material on offer. The bathrooms were small and weren't very clean and there were two shower rooms for use separate from the toilets. There was a reasonable view of the tarmac but overall it was not a great experience. I felt like I was in the lobby of a  star hotel.,3,-0.232618709
P Rubenstein,Thai does not have access to a proper lounge and instead contracts with Alitalia. As such one is treated to the poor quality that Alitalia has become famous for. Limited food options consisted of dried out quiche some sort of bread and tomato pastry and nothing else. In fairness to Thai Airways this may be the best it can offer as Alitalia seems to have been given the monopoly on lounges in the terminal. All I can say is why bother? There is no service no assistance and nothing relaxing about the lounge. I was more comfortable wandering about the oppressively hot terminal than in sitting in the foul smelling lounge. Thai should make an effort and see what it subjects its clients to.,1,-1.798894906
D Jackson,The selection of food in this business class lounge is abysmal. For instance this morning's breakfast offering - as it has been every morning the last  years I've flown the airline - was boiled slices of sandwich ham hot dogs and boiled eggs along with an assortment of industrial-grade dim sum and tea sandwiches. I find TG's poor quality food inexplicable given Thailand's deserved reputation for affordable tasty cuisine. There are too few toilets many of which are out-of-service,,
M Gilbert,Thai Airways use the SAS lounge at T Heathrow which is quite big split over two floors with views out towards the runways. The seating varies from comfortable armchairs to bar stools  there are also segregated rooms for business use and a children's area. Lots of computer stations on the ground floor with a decent snack bar and a good choice of wines  beer and soft drinks. Upstairs each seating area had power points and wifi available to connect laptops plus another snack bar with a selection of food and drinks available including draught beer on tap. The staff did the job but not much interaction with the passengers  washrooms clean and tidy and overall ok for a short visit but would not want to be there on a long delay.,4,0.550519389
Colleen Cutcheon,We had the misfortune to visit the Alitalia Lounge which Thai Airways use in Rome. This would have to be the worst Business Class Lounge we have ever experienced. There was nowhere to sit when we first arrived even though I have to use a stick. When I finally found somewhere to sit the cream lounge chairs were filthy. The floor looked like it needed a good clean also. There was no food except peanuts and tiny biscuits. There were no clean glasses. Eventually some dried out sandwiches arrived which vanished as quick as they came. The staff gave the impression they did not want to be there and on the whole it was a very unpleasant experience. Is this the best Thai Airways can offer their loyal Business Class Passengers?,1,-1.798894906
M Gilbert,The lounge is a reasonable size for the number of passengers but can get quite busy. The layout is not bad but not the best compared to other lounges at the airport. Food is quite limited but the drinks available are plentiful and varied. The toilets and showers were modern and clean but no toiletries supplied  staff seemed hard working and friendly. Overall not a bad lounge for a short stay but would not like to be there on a long flight delay.,3,-0.232618709
M Gilbert,The main lounge is quite large with plenty of seating but a little bit tired and worn  the other smaller business lounge is more comfortable with a good selection of food and variety of drinks on offer. Staff very friendly and willing to help  washrooms and shower kept in good order but can get very busy at certain times.,4,0.550519389
R Cooper,Relatively simple functional lounge. Seats are comfortable' however the lighter colour ones are prone to staining. No sofas/couches. Food options are mainly for the Asian market (to be expected in Hong Kong) so doesn't leave much for western tastes particularly at breakfast. Nice and quiet on a Sunday morning as not many TG flights and I was on Air NZ. Offered a shower but declined.,4,0.550519389
Michael Shortland,This is the Star Alliance lounge open to many customers. First impressions are not good: cold poorly lit and noisy (with low ceilings). Food looks poor and wine selection is terrible. No champagne few magazines: really a disappointment for a premium destination.,2,-1.015756808
N Werner,The Royal Silk Lounge is right after immigration and allows for easy access. Staff nice and friendly and a lot of seats available. Food selection always the same and it is a pity they do not offer any nice Thai food only some snacks. Drinks selection is good. The location of the lounge does not really give good views and it is quite loud at times with announcements from the terminal building and one can constantly hear the moving walkways warning people that it ends. As we only spent min in the lounge before boarding it was fine however I would not want to be stuck there for a long transit. Next time I will try another Royal Silk Lounge at BKK.,4,0.550519389
Chris Anderson,Good spacious lounge. A little dark but comfy good food available in the morning but only snacks not really breakfast items full bar available self serve and friendly smiling staff shower room is ok only  showers but wasn't busy when I was there.,4,0.550519389
Philip Rubenstein,Flying a Star alliance carrier gave me a choice between the United Red Carpet Lounge or the Thai Airways Lounge. It was a no brainer and I opted for TG which offers a superior lounge experience to North American carriers. The TG lounge while not as good as BKK was still top quality. There was an assortment of hot & cold foods along with a decent beverage option. The lounge was crowded but there were still some seats available. First Class passengers have little designated private booth type seating areas and again it is less impressive than the TG st experience in BKK. I did have a chuckle though as the seating option and lounge experience that the st class PAX had was hardly worth the fare difference between st and Business. The only negative aspect of the lounge was the absence of electric sockets where one could plug in a laptop.,4,0.550519389
A Evans,A small lounge with comfy chairs and toilets. Reasonable selection of drinks and small selection of food. Not many people in lounge as I was waiting.,3,-0.232618709
John Stedman,Has to be the best First Class lounge. The service is second to none. From the moment you check-in they take you through a special customs area and down the escalators and then a buggy is waiting to take you to the lounge. My family was traveling and we had our own room and the service did not stop - we were there for  hours. There is a dining room which you select off the menu and so it keeps going on. This is the lounge you want when you have a long transit. When we arrived back into Bangkok from Rome they picked us up in buggies from the airbridge and drove us all the way to our luggage which was waiting the staff then collected and escorted us out to our waiting bus which took us to our hotel - did not touch our bags since we left Rome until we got to the hotel.,5,1.333657488
R Johnson,I've had the unfortunate circumstance of being stuck in long layovers thrice in the last year at BKK. If it weren't for the high quality lounge I think I would have gone a bit batty. It's basically a very large lounge and mostly self serve everything. Also if you have a long layover the lounge offers complimentary  minute Thai massages which I found quite nice. Internet Facilities and speed is excellent. The food selection is mostly hors d'oeuvres type but there is many to choose from.,4,0.550519389
Mark Gilbert,The lounge is looking a bit tired and tatty but still clean and tidy plenty of food and drink with very attentive staff. No shower available but there is a spa lounge. Toilets kept clean by very friendly staff and glasses plates etc removed promptly. Flight info screens but no loudspeaker broadcasts which makes for a more relaxing stay.,4,0.550519389
Rod Johnson,During our long layover at BKK we got to experience lounges on both concourses D and C. Whilst the lounge on concourse D was much bigger and had a slightly better range of food on offer I was surprised that to have a shower you had to move to the smaller lounge on Concourse C. Not very convenient when you're tired. The food and drinks on offer were of high standard and staff were cleaning the tables and replenishing the food. Except for the shower issue it was a pleasant long layover.,4,0.550519389
I Wenseritt,I use the Lounge in BKK at least every  weeks with same experience. No wines offered since years only fat puff pastry small Sandwich and Chinese Steam-buns Stale rolls Toast Jam Butter and sometimes cold cuts. Some cakes are available too. Either the puff pastry or the Steam-buns are cold. Bangkok is the Homebase of Thai and have the worst Lounge.,3,-0.232618709
Doug Cockroft,Modern and clean lounge with efficient and friendly staff. comfortable lounge seats good showers and toilets and a good variety of food (changed every couple of hours). The espresso/cappuccino machine did the job. Wifi was easy to connect to and fast. Low light : no wine in the lounge. Odd that. Not much of a cost saving if it forces passengers to consume the spirits!,5,1.333657488
Michael Barry,We have used this lounge many times in the past and been more than happy. However this time it was a bit disappointing to see the quality had dropped. The wine and champagne selection used to be wonderful this time they were of a much cheaper standard. I have had better when flying in economy. They do offer a good selection of food and the lounge is clean and comfortable.,4,0.550519389
L Engstrom,Not at all what you would expect from a Business Class Lounge. It was was understaffed most of the tables were filled with dirty plates and cutlery. The lounge looks old and run down. Very poor selection of food. Puff rolls filled with chicken mushrooms quiches and some very tired looking fruit. The selection has been the same for about  years. Thai airways Business Lounges have to be the only ones in the world without wine!! The airlines make a lot of money from their business class passengers so Thai airways should be able to afford to upgrade their lounges.,2,-1.015756808
K Mercer,From the greeting at kerbside pick up where your luggage and check in are dealt with whilst you relax to the buggy that takes you to the lounge. The itself is spacious and clean with very attentive staff. We were placed in our own side lounge on our outward journey and then in mini slumber rooms on our return as our stopover was quite long. After sleeping we showered in the clean bathrooms then ate in the restaurant with all food freshly cooked. The Spa was sensational total relaxation. We were then escorted from the lounge to our seats on the aircraft.,5,1.333657488
Scott Dyke,This is great lounge in the heart of the airport good for transfers. I prefer this lounge to the larger lounge one is directed towards on entering the airport. Having just done a leg from London to BKK I was able to shower in very well kept facilities before the last leg of the journey. The showers were powerful and hot towels large and fluffy just as they should be. I had time for a sit down and gin and tonic before the departure of my flight - my only gripe was the lack of a glass of wine - I guess a cultural thing. Wifi connection was easy.,4,0.550519389
N Sutherland,A little oasis of quiet in an otherwise very busy terminal. The lounge is spacious on  levels with a variety of seating and some very nice Macs in the Internet Areas. I thought the food and drinks choices were pretty basic but okay for a short visit. SAS London Lounge makes T almost bearable - almost.,4,0.550519389
J Gray,The lounge was understaffed: one woman was responsible for cleaning and catering in the two hours prior to the departure of a TG flight. Many tables were piled up with dirty plates and cutlery and weren't cleaned in the time I was there. There were no glasses at all for drinks - you had to ask. Small and unappealing selection of baked items as well as cups of noodles. Spirits and beer available but no wine. A very disappointing lounge.,2,-1.015756808
Paul Rex,The least impressive business lounge I have seen for some time. Cramped dingy and full of mosquitoes. My family moved to the main waiting area one by one driven out by the depressing atmosphere frequent insect bites and noise from one extended family with small children.,2,-1.015756808
Brian Noad,The staff food and service here are all excellent. Staff most helpful with connecting flights. Great internet access very fast. Must be one of the world's best airport lounges.,5,1.333657488
Manfred Haberkorn,Great Lounge. I travelled Swiss First Class and thus was invited to use the THAI AIRWAYS Lounge. Unfortunately the usage of the SPA is only permitted for THAI customers not for pax from partner airlines. Welcome at the desk is very friendly professional. Seating is very comfortable THAI also offers separate suites all were reserved though seemingly for THAI pax only. The service is professional friendly and unobtrusive. All kinds of drinks and cocktails are served. At the seat snacks are on offer from a snack menu. In case of major appetite some main courses international and Thai dishes can be ordered and are served in the cozy little restaurant at the end of the lounge. A big selection of national and international newspapers and magazines is spread out. Also a nice touch for me a small smokers lounge separate from the other lounge areas is available and drinks are served there also. Finally a very nice and comfortable lounge quiet and giving privacy.,4,0.550519389
G Wenseritt,Not what you would expect in a Business Class Lounge. Over years still the same poor selection on finger food. Puff rolls filled with Chicken Mushrooms Vegetarian Quiches some fruit soup. They have a good variety on drinks but no red/white wine as most others offer. Internet access is quite good. After I visited a few times the Thai Lounge in Hong Kong I was even more disappointed about the Bangkok Lounge at the Home base!,3,-0.232618709
N Sutherland,This Lounge has been open  years now and the earlier problems (poor air conditioning gloomy corridor like interior dreadful toilets) all remain unchanged - as has the snacks menu. Three years on and they still offer precisely the same collection of dreary sandwiches and pastries. The Internet Room appeared to be a play area for children when I visited. There's a reasonable drinks choice but not as good as the old lounges in Don Muang - they now have a small Duty Free Shop which is a useful provision. Perhaps they could channel some of the profit from that into fixing the problems in the lounge. Airlines make a lot of profit from their Business Class Customers and it would be nice to see some of this put back into the Lounge at Thai's home airport.,3,-0.232618709
J Gray,For Thai's Flagship Business Class Lounge this was disappointing. Though the seating arrangements were comfortable the long layout made it feel like you're sitting in a corridor. The food selection was pathetic,,
Dang Pham,The Best First Class Lounge ever visit until now. Welcome begins at the gate on arriving of the plane go by an electric cart to the Royal First Lounge. I was assigned a private room with large HD TV.  dedicated lounge hostesses for the services during the entire stay. An extensive menu is presented. You can eat in a -stars restaurant setting or in your own private lounge. You will be the last to board. A hostess will call personally for your flight and take you to the gate by an electric cart and to your seat on the plane.,5,1.333657488
W Chia,The First class lounge is an oasis. Attentive staff that really are taking care of you. Nice private living room area. Food and drinks on demand. The Spa for First class passengers is amazing with nice amenities and also a hr massage is included. Only wifi was a bit slow but and could not find a menu for drinks and meals. However it was overall a nice experience.,4,0.550519389
Michael Kasberg,This is one of the best lounges worldwide. A lot of staff is caring about all needs. They have a dining menu with a wide selection of food if you want eat before your flight. Thai Airways passengers are invited to the spa where a free oil/neck and shoulder or foot massage is offered. But between . pm and midnight due to many departures the lounge is overcrowded and sometimes very noisy. The washrooms are very big with a nice selection of L'occitane products. After every use someone comes for cleaning.,5,1.333657488
Bryan Rogers,The main lounge is very long and doesn't really provide a very cosy feel. Staff are abundant friendly and attentive. Free WiFi access is available and it's adequate but quite slow. One gripe that so many of us have is the lack of power easily accessible power outlets for our laptops. The Thai lounge at Suvarnabhumi is fairly new and it's a shame that the designers didn't do what most modern airports are doing (such as NRT) and provide easily accessible outlets for every seat. One major bonus is the offer of a  minute massage in the adjacent First Class spa with options for either a foot massage or a head and neck massage. Perfect for relaxing just prior to boarding. My biggest complain would be the catering which is limited to dry snacks small cheap white bread sandwiches instant noodle and various small but rather oily warm pies. The Thai lounge really pales in comparison to their competition in this area. It's also interesting to me that the food catering is actually much better in Thai lounges at other airports Hong Kong for example where various hot dishes are provided and even ice cream. Even the dingy overcrowded Thai lounge at MNL offers a better food catering service. One would think that Thai's flagship home base lounges would provide the best catering but this is not the case.,4,0.550519389
P Chen,It offers fairly basic comfort levels but would expect more from the home airport for Transaero Airlines. No shower was possible during my stopover and disappointed by that. Internet was okay lounge not too crowded when I visited (midday) but food choice was quite limited. Did noty find the staff friendly - they seemed to be poor on English language skills and just stared at me politely for most questions.,3,-0.232618709
Scott Wilson,Late transfer staff helpful directed me to a decent sized shower room (with toilet) to freshen up for the next flight ahead. Busy lounge with relatively few seats but quiet enough and clean. Very little reading material but ok to sit and relax. Food selection mostly cold pastry products and poor quality sugary desserts. Internet access through terminals that I wouldn't trust as PCs concerned had vast amounts of software that had been installed on them by past users. Biggest inconvenience is having to queue up for security between lounge and gates with no priority queue. Overall great staff comfortable environment good shower/bathroom facilities but needs a big rethink on food.,3,-0.232618709
E Connor,Am lucky enough to use the business lounge at Bangkok frequently and since the new airport opened I can say how much better the lounge is. The lighting is tranquil and soothing with plenty of comfortable seating. The staff are more than accommodating constantly replenishing the snacks and drinks and keeping all areas spotless. The washrooms too are very good and clean - always important when your about to board a flight and need to freshen up. All in all an excellent lounge with all you require before the start of your journey.,5,1.333657488
Anthony Roxburgh,What an amazing service - we were greeted by Thai Staff as we enter the separate entrance to First Class check-in at the Airport. Our bags and tickets were taken and check-in completed by Thai Staff whilst we were seated in comfort. We were then escorted thru immigrations then onto a private buggy vehicle to the first class lounge. Truly amazing and beautiful lounge and extremely attentive staff. We were shown to a private room with lounge table working desk with wifi plug and flat screen tv. You could actually choose what you would like to eat and it was all prepared fresh and delivered to our mini suite. This is one of those memorable  star experiences that I will always remember.,5,1.333657488
Anthony Roxburgh,This has to be one of the worst First Class lounges I have ever been in. It was suppose to be a First Class lounge but I believe they were letting anyone in. The lounge was old and tired and in need of a complete overhaul. When I entered the lounge I was told I would have to PAY  Euro for the wifi connection. The best they could do for catering was a pizza mangled into odd shapes and pieces thrown on a plate. Seating and decor was very uncomfortable and out dated. I actually walked out to the airport toilets as the lounge toilets were a disgrace.,2,-1.015756808
Patrick DuPlessis,Used the lounge twice in July and really quite impressed! Got a buggy ride from arrival aircraft straight to the lounge. Plenty of seats in the lounge but best part is the Thai Spa facility opposite - had a truly relaxing massage here and some health drinks that were just great. Staff in the lounge really nice and very efficient. Food not so good compared to many First Class lounges today and maybe Thai can improve that. Washrooms and shower rooms immaculate and nice amenities. A small sleep / quiet area but did not use that this time. Goof WiFi access and this was consistent.,5,1.333657488
Roger Stone,Thai share the Air New Zealand lounge at Sydney Airport. My experience was not a happy one. This started with my being initially refused entry by the guy at the front desk because 'my name was not on the list' . Turns out he had the wrong list and was using the passenger list for TG from the night before. I must have been the first for the morning flight to Bangkok to arrive. Half an hour later I'm finally admitted but then met with noisy kids and a dull lounge. Better than no lounge at all but I did not stay there long.,3,-0.232618709
Ingo Wenseritt,Used the Lounge before E Gate. Good beverage selection but boring Food selection. Never changed in  years or longer? Don't understand the  seat arrangement as most travelers are alone and use the time with their Laptops. Sockets are very limited. Often problems with the coffee machines which are full stickers and leftovers of tape glue. Aircon not very good as in the whole Airport. WIFI often crash. Friendly Staff and good cleaning of tables. Kids Playground available as well as Computer rooms. No Flight information screens available so watch your time. Overall I liked the Dong Muang Lounges at all locations much more.,4,0.550519389
Geoff Becque,"Classic Thai welcome on arrival - very airy lounge with more private areas leading off. Comfortable seating and a full dining area if required. Full choice of food - freshly prepared to order - do not help yourself! The club sandwich is as good as it gets. Full bar inc champagne but disappointed with the reds - no Pinot Noir. Staff will escort you the  yds to the Spa for a complimentary massage - well worth doing to ease jet lag. There are showers and private cabins with sleeper seats for longer stopovers. If there is a gripe it is that the toilets are ""no flushing of tissues"". I know that the whole of the airport waste disposal is based on this principal but I havn't experienced this since some  years ago I had a holiday in a Greek Taverna! The whole Thai First experience - aircraftcabin service ground service and the First Lounge makes Thai the only carrier to use in and out of its home base.",5,1.333657488
Jess Delegencia,The Concourse C lounge is the least crowded offers showers and a sleeping space. The bathroom amenities are really nice. The food can be better and the staff always seem busy going in and out of the kitchen. The internet and computers seem to have problems. If you are a Thai business class passenger you can use the lounge spa and get a free -minute massage - this is the best part- but only if you are actually flying Thai business (or first) class.,3,-0.232618709
R Gamba,I was on Air Canada flight to Vancouver and had a choice between this lounge and the Red Carpet lounge next door. As I have been to the Red Carpet lounge before I opted to stay in this lounge. The lounge was small but really airy. Food selection was ample and fantastic. WiFi was great.Staff very helpful and attentive. I was travelling with my niece though she was travelling with Cathay Pacific but the lady at the reception made sure that she got in after paying a minimal fee. Now that's customer service! Quite the contrary when I went to the Cathay Pacific lounge on Christmas day. I was holding a business class boarding pass and my nephews were travelling economy. They needed to take a shower and when I talked to the people at the reception they were not willing to let them in even after I offered to pay.,5,1.333657488
M Nal,"This is what you call business class, in fact you could call it First Class. Mountains of food, good wifi, friendly and professional staff, plenty of seating. But it is the food that makes this place. Prepared by DoCo I believe.",6,2.116795586
A Arriens,"Friendly reception, clean, big windows, calm atmosphere. No clock or time visible, Not easy to find (mainly due to work in progress at the terminal).  Broken glasses offered. Lighting was on, while there was more than enough light from outside because of the sunny day. No shaded windows. The inside temperature was high, in combination with the lighting. High occupation, during busy times so even less comfort and food available. Grey interior, not welcoming, feels more static. Food is scarce. Very little improvement overall, compared to prior to the renovation. This is an outstation shared lounge, affecting all customer airlines of the ground handler.",1,-1.798894906
P Dyson,Best business lounge I have experienced. Plenty of drinks and food and lots to keep you entertained Spotlessly clean.,5,1.333657488
N Carrera,Massive with different areas ranging from a romantic setting in the middle next to a large Turkish Airlines globe to an elegant piano bar a garden setting in second floor and tea bar etc. There is even a golf course simulator downstairs. Food is delicious and staff extremely attentive and friendly. My negative feedback is that they do not have nearly enough English Spanish German newspapers. I can understand why they will not have ES or DE newspapers but surely they can muster better than only the Wall Street Journal in English?,5,1.333657488
M Smyth,This is one of the nicest Star Alliance lounges. Large with excellent selections of fresh hot and cold food. Beverages are excellent and a huge range to choose from.,4,0.550519389
Shane Tarr,Excellent lounge although the toilets always seem to be busy. It must be the fantastic food and very good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages available. I have read it gets very crowded but when I used the lounge - for  hours on the th of February - it was less crowded than for instance Thai Lounges in Bangkok Singapore Lounges in Singapore or Air NZ lounges in New Zealand. I won't stoop so low and comment on how much superior this lounge is to typical North American business class lounge: everyone who travels knows that.,4,0.550519389
H Jansen,Lounge in IST apparently won prizes which is beyond me - feels like a major cafeteria/canteen - it is huge and not to me liking. Absolutely crowded despite being so big and completely lacks all levels of personalized service feeling. Upon entering the lounge boarding pass beeped by a TK rep with zero eye contact. Food on offer very confusing and one has to go to several different places in the lounge to for instance get a breakfast plate. Eggs one place juice a second place and then coffee a third place etc. Highly time consuming and feels like a marathon for both customers and staff.,2,-1.015756808
Ahmet Altiner,This is for the domestic CIP lounge in Izmir. This is a lovely clean lounge with great bathrooms and friendly staff. The design is homey yet modern. There is adequate amount of snacks but not extensive hot food selection. No alcohol only coffee tea and soft drinks. They drive you directly to your flight (so you do not need to go back to the gate) which is fantastic!,4,0.550519389
L Brown,A massive airport to negotiate. Staff very unhelpful and rude. Once the lounge is found the staff at the desk and barriers are rude. The lounge is large and needs to be as its extremely busy. The food choices are excellent. We had a  hour wait so saw breakfast and lunch. Spotlessly clean.,5,1.333657488
M Parlar,This is one of the best business lounges I have been to. Lounge is huge with all kinds of food and drink stations throughout each with many choices. Tea & Coffee stations Alcoholic Drink Stations Cold food and hot food stations and they are very good to excellent. Lounge personnel are helpful and friendly. Shower facilities are nice and very clean. I would say that they can definitely do better on their Wifi service as it is problematic which is annoying.,5,1.333657488
T Eldem,With the exception of staff language skills this lounge is simply exceptional. Food and beverage choices are unbelievably wide. There is plenty of activities to pass time and the food quality is terrific. Bathrooms are spotless and very nicely appointed. Showers sleeper suites and complimentary massage service are fantastic Quite possibly the best business lounge out there.,5,1.333657488
K Baki,Busy lounge but large enough to accommodate everybody. It has traditional cooking stands amusement for kids nice style calm and spacious.,5,1.333657488
S Richardson,It is amazing. Food centres in different spots cooking areas a great array and choice. Comfortable seating plenty of seating and very clean washroom facilities . It was a pleasure to be waiting in this business lounge definitely.,5,1.333657488
Daniel Houser,Unbelievably good. Pool table & library many bars glass enclosures with locks for luggage many chefs and self-service top-shelf liquor game room for the kids showers etc. The food was fantastic of course Turkish coffee and Turkish Delight and probably an acre in size. I've been in hundreds of business class lounges and I thought nothing could top Singapore Air in Changi until I flew through Istanbul.,5,1.333657488
Derek Salter,A very pleasant experience. I enjoy using Turkish Airlines - good fares and helpful staff but the airport can be cramped and crowded. As was the lounge until expanded recently. A joy to visit - you hope for a longer stay between flights! Good food variety of seating areas and airy. I can't wait to use again. Probably only downside is the number of toilets and washrooms which are often very busy.,5,1.333657488
S McKenna,The best business lounge I have had the pleasure of spending time in. Food excellent. Roaming masseurs were welcome. Showers spotless. Bag storage area neat. Beautiful design. Toilets immaculate. My only gripe was my stop over was eight hours and a suite could only be booked if staying - hours. I was offered the use of a hotel room in Istanbul but declined. Lounge was only really busy from .-. during my stay.,5,1.333657488
G Santon,First time in the new lounge area and wow - what a difference! Divided on two floors so much space and not overcrowded any more. The food options are truly second to none with freshly prepared food counters in many parts of the lounge. Got to use a lounge bedroom (very comfortable) and enjoyed shower in -Star hotel standard bathroom. Big boy's Scalextric track also fun! At last it looks like Turkish Airlines have really turned a corner in progress and this is the best lounge I have visited. Pity that the rest of Istanbul airport is so poor.,5,1.333657488
Peter Jacobsen,Following the expansion of the THY lounge at Istanbul Ataturk it is no longer overcrowded. It has an impressive selection of freshly made foods and pastries but also services such as cinema and massage. The atmosphere is nice and quiet (no boarding calls) and the lounge is light with plenty of windows and lighting to make it comfortable.,5,1.333657488
S Taylor,"I visited twice in the last week and both times it was ""full"". The design is quite interesting but in trying to accommodate so many people it is not a relaxing place to be. The staff were working hard but it is not easy with so many people.",3,-0.232618709
E Rietz,I used this lounge twice flying from BRU to BKK and back. A catastrophic visit in both cases totally overcrowded almost no seat to find very noisy and really unacceptable!,2,-1.015756808
Helmut Schmid,This is one of the best lounges regarding food and beverages choice activities (eg. a theater where you can watch movies or concerts billiard piano). Lounge team work in rush hours to avoid problems.,5,1.333657488
Keith Rogers,Very neat design very large with lots of seating areas many food stations. A real treat on a long layover traveling from Houston via Istanbul onto Dushanbe. This has to be one of the top airline lounges.,5,1.333657488
Brian Payne,In theory the lounge is quite nice but at peak periods you should not even bother going to the lounge. It is normally full to overflowing staff will not offer any assistance to find seats etc. The washrooms and shower facilities are quite poor and badly maintained. Good snack and other foods if you can find anywhewre to sit. Staff service is good for the catering type staff but Turkish Airlines staff are rude and well below standard.,3,-0.232618709
T Ellis,The literature states that this place has a capacity for  people. There must be at least twice that many here. No seats no food no power sockets. This cannot be called 'business' as it is impossible to do any. All I wanted in my three hour stop over was to charge my laptop send some emails and have something to eat. Impossible. Never using Turkish again to fly on business travel. In summary - overcrowded noisy access to basic facilities that the business traveller needs non-existent and a surly overworked team of staff.,2,-1.015756808
Andrew Smith,Huge sprawling open-plan lounge rammed full of people with a very random and disorganised lay-out. Also not one real quiet area with groups of people sitting around shouting people listening to iPads laptops on speaker - just very chaotic and not a nice place to wait for a flight.,3,-0.232618709
Manfred Christall,After a quite long walk over the airport you find a big lounge. There are lockers where you can store your bags a small cinema kids-area several coffee and tea-bars a grill where you can get sandwiches bbqued chicken and beef soups cheese salads pasta and desserts. Food quantity is impressive all offers taste good some very good. Internet stations are available and free wifi. The shower rooms are clean and nicely designed.,4,0.550519389
N Carter," I travel frequently from IST but typically don't use Turkish Airlines for business so this was my first time in the new lounge. I didn't use the showers nor many of the other amenities but the one's I tried to take advantage of didn't instil confidence. I wasn't impressed with the lounge: I thought they might be having an ""off"" day so I asked to speak to someone in charge. It took nearly a half an hour to find someone. the excuse for not having an available manager in the lounge was that it wasn't a busy time of the day despite it being : in the afternoon on a Friday and packed. It was far too busy and loud. If indeed the mornings are busier I would hate to see it. After sorting through the piles of newspapers that seemed to be tossed haphazardly on the tables - they don't use magazine racks - I found that there were no English newspapers in the lounge. According to the lounge manager they ""have them but they typically run out in the morning"". Knowing that the idea of having some more for the afternoon passengers hadn't occurred to her. Food quality seemed good but accessing catering was very chaotic. For example there are two chefs working in tandem",,
J Anastos,I was looking forward to visiting this lounge but my experience was bad. We arrived at am from a long Hong Kong flight and had about  minutes to rest before the next leg. The lounge was crowded and there were no seats! We wanted coffee and just to relax but there was no place to sit we wandered around for almost  minutes before finally grabbing an open seat. All the lockers were also full so nowhere to stash our carryon bags we had to lug them around the lounge too. And to make matters worse the showers were all full for an entire hour. We felt like we were at the Grand Bazaar pushing and shoving our way just to find a seat and a cup of coffee. In a word it was stressful not relaxing at all.,3,-0.232618709
J Brito,From dedicated baggage screening luggage lock boxes baristas preparing a la carte coffee drinks Apple Computer Stations luxurious bathrooms well furnished and decorated lounges to cordial and helpful staff wife and I were thoroughly impressed with Business Class Lounge. Turkish Airways single Airport Club to serve every category of premium ticket holding passenger or frequent flyer may not be for those seeking exclusivity or tiered service areas yet it worked well for us. Accounting for quality and quantity of food when flying long-haul business class we found food selection and portions appropriate for a lay-over stay in lounge. We were also not expecting nor did we avail ourselves of a private sleeper rooms in Business Class Lounge. I disagree with reviewer stating that Turkish custom of allowing Police officers to eat/drink for free must be stop. I did not observe police coming in and drinking tea/coffee. People in their role as citizens or public or private policy role of any given country that treat those who provide service whether public service / infrastructure or service industry as second class citizens have much to learn from Turkish way if not Turkish Airways! I found it a pleasant surprise when observing Turkish hotel employees eating from breakfast buffet.,5,1.333657488
R White,Lounge is expansive and nicely furnished with a lot of options for how to spend your time. It can get quite crowded though and while there are lots of drinks on offer the food is limited and more snack based. The reception staff had a smile which ticks that box and the rest seemed very pleasant though they were just picking up cups. Overall nice place to spend time though worth exploring it to find a quiet corner when busy.,4,0.550519389
Marc Pauquet,Wonderful lounge excellent food and nice drinks. Beside the chefs the TGS ground staff had poor English and provided a very cold and impersonal service.,4,0.550519389

Movie room especially handy for children. Prayer rooms available and massage therapist roams giving free chair massages that were amazing.,5,1.333657488
Sasha Guignard,"There are two lounges next to each other used by all airlines. Located above Immigration the main view is of the gates and runway. Access is by invite (Business Class and/or top tier FFP member). Operated by the same company the food and beverages are limited in choice and are the same in both lounges. Staff serve you alcoholic drinks/juices and various types of coffee/tea. and  the hot items from the food station. Soft drinks and cold food are self service. There is a smoking room. At the peak time of the day .-. the lounge can get very full and in this case you may be invited to use the lounge next door. Some staff have limited English and on this visit were relatively friendly. The toilets were clean. There is free internet/wi-fi as well as  computer stations for guests to use. There is also a limited choice of reading material in Ukrainian Russian French Dutch and English. There is room for improvement and hopefully the lounge management will make this a priority.""",6,2.116795586
R Deu,Excellent catering delicious cakes lots of space for reading relaxing. Wonderful showers and toilets very good internet PC. Like the arabic touch in some areas very clean and state-or-the-art design. Staff must improve in all areas especially at the entrance and waiters.,5,1.333657488
B Yazici,"Pleasantly surprised when I visited after an absence of  months. Much bigger and nicer than the old lounge. Lots of food and drinks choices. Washrooms are nicer. I am not sure I like the ""minaret"" style. Too Arabic for my liking. Must point out the interesting acoustic trait the minarets have caused. If you start hearing random people speaking and there is no one around you don't worry you haven't lost the plot or turned schizophrenic. The minarets carry and bounce voices around much like the whispering gallery at St Paul's cathedral. I could hear some talking a good  meters away around a  degree bend. The Turkish custom of allowing Police officers to eat/drink for free must also stop. They kept on coming in and drinking tea/coffee. Didn't interact that much with the staff so can't really comment.",5,1.333657488
F Bartels,The lounge is nicely redecorated and looks stylish. The coffee bar is amazing but other than that there is nothing more nice to say. Staff at the reception were rude unfriendly and unable to help with flight changes. There is also no fresh orange juice - though they specially announce it - the same thing onboard. It is not even juice just lemonade with part juice concentrate content. Dayrooms are unavailable as they give them out late at night for  hours and with am arrival all rooms were blocked. As well there are not enough showers - a waiting time of  minutes is not acceptable. Not thought through for an airline with mainly transfer pax. No high-quality amenities - bulk stuff in a push-bottle! Everything is meant good but not done well. Staff has a lot room for improvement!,3,-0.232618709
S Latif,A great looking Lounge but third class service standards. I have not seen a lounge with such poorly trained staff. The lady handling Concierge desk was the most unpleasant one. No smile no care or consideration for the customers. Staff continuously talking to each other and could not care one way or the other for the passengers.,3,-0.232618709

Paul Bailey,This newly renovated lounge provides a relaxing experience and is very spacious. The toilets/showers are stylish and modern. The negative comment I would make is relating to the staff who I found rather unfriendly.,4,0.550519389
Stephen Williams,The lounge has just reopened after a  month renovation. The design is very modern with a circular theme. There are numerous drink stations and food bars with most delicious Turkish food provided by Do&Co. Plenty of space food drinks barista service multiple TV entertainment Pool table and a library. The shower suites and toilet facilities are very stylish with marble tiling wood paneling and mirrored walls. High quality Etro toiletries provided in the showers along with towels slippers and bathrobe. There are only  iMacs for guests which use an odd keyboard with many standard keys replaced with non-standard keys. No @ symbol on the keyboard which made them almost impossible to use. The only downside is the that the staff are still coming to terms with the new facilities and on the whole they all need to learn to smile and relax a bit instead of grunting.,4,0.550519389
R Jager,Showers are shabby and dirty a disgrace to this airline. Towels were thin and when we complained they were able to give us regular towels. Housekeeping of the lounge is reasonable and the tables were cleaned more often than they do at the other airline lounges. Thoroughly disappointed re the lounge amenities.,2,-1.015756808
Stuart Bingham,Tired and shabby. Shower very poor not really clean small thin towels shower head kept dropping forward. Food choice poor and only soup as a hot option - which for breakfast i found unusual! A poor location for Turkish Airlines home Lounge at Aturturk. Have no desire to return.,2,-1.015756808

E Teh,I used the Turkish Lounge at IST as a J pax with another Star Alliance carrier. The lay out was airy and the decor was mainly Ottoman-style. There were shower facilities (again Ottoman- style with marble sinks etc). Food choices were adequate for mid afternoon with the usual selection of hot & cold snacks. There were a few different areas (large comfy sofas quiet area computers etc).,4,0.550519389
Nick Paul,Good choice of facilities. Business services prayer room refreshments etc. Range of seating available - in seperate lounges for meals on sofas in open plan area etc.. and plenty of space for discreet discussions if required. Decoration quite impressive. Intrusive noise though from  tvs on different channels plus some noise from other areas of airport. Nice choice of drinks and snacks available and constant cleaning from staff kept the whole area very neat and presentable. As a non- drinker can not comment on size of a glass offered as on other reviews but range of drinks was quite broad if wanted. Soft drinks include teas coffees orange juice waters etc. Staff I found to be excellent not at all rude or dismissive and very welcoming. Also there was no pervasive cigarette smoke evident - very welcome to a non-smoker in Turkey. Location of Lounge is at one end of the airport and can be quite a few minutes to walk to gates but shops and other services close to Lounge so no need to walk unnecessarily far. A good and comfortable service.,4,0.550519389
Nick Paul,Small CIP Lounge with nice choice of drinks and snacks. Limited office space for business if required comfortable sofas / seating and quiet space without excess noise from airport operation. Nice lounge conveniently close to gates and good efficient staff to assist if needed.,4,0.550519389
Idat Erdener,The lounge is very specious and has an interesting decoration. I have been at all peak times there and there was always enough space to sit and relax. There are showers available (some review say it has not) - to use it you should contact the front desk staff for amenities and staff was mostly friendly. The choice of alcoholic drinks could be increased though and size of glasses as well. A slient room for taking a nap is missing though.,4,0.550519389
JOHANNES BOECKER,"The ""new"" lounge is located at the exact opposite end of the airport. It is quite a hike there but most flights to Asia and the US depart from there so I guess it is ok. It is quite unique : huge sofas and armchairs impressive chandeliers (like in a palace) and soft carpets. At peak times seating is very limited and I saw people leave the lounge because of not enough seating. There is an open bar with a wide selection of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) - albeit glasses are very small - and some snacks (puff pastry and sandwiches). There are no showers which is quite a disappointment after a long flight. Bathrooms could be cleaner. There is a business center with free internet access and there are of course muslim prayer rooms. Staff is rude (as you would expect from Turkish Airlines) but all in all the lounge is a vast improvement over the old one.",3,-0.232618709
Oscar Cano,"This airport lounge is a joke, noting that United uses Newark as one of its main bases. The lounge is big and with natural light with view to the planes. That's all.

Walter Mahan,"I was told after May   there would be a $ dollar charge per person per visit even if you had a First Class ticket. I paid it just to see if there was any value in the upcharge.

W. Robert Kmen,"I visited the United Club in the D Concourse this morning, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I had been skeptical about the improvements that UA has claimed have been made to its major clubs, but the food offerings have indeed been much improved. In particular, Greek yoghurt was offered with a huge bowl of fresh strawberries and blueberries. If I had had ample time, I could have fashioned a tasty breakfast. The club is larger than I expected, and even at : AM, there was ample and comfortable seating. The large windows look out onto a busy tarmac, so there were interesting views. I am a lifetime member of the United Club, and I am now convinced that I made a worthwhile investment.",6,2.116795586

V Zeiger,"Worst lounge I've ever experienced. Old and worn out crowded no adequate number of seats service nonexistent and offered nothing but cheap snacks. Furthermore most supplies were always empty or ""will be"" be replenished. No hot food or proper cold food except bar snacks in plastic disposable cups. Not all beverages are complementary - $ for a decent drink - and grumpy staff expects tips for serving free beer! Awful overcrowded no accommodations no service for handicapped people.The food selection is unhealthy and at best more like an unhealthy snack bar. The same goes for the bar. The wine is bad and the beer selection is main stream and boring. There's no sense for details. Last and most important the staff seems as worn out as the lounge. No smiles no pride. Just hanging in there. Like they know the company they work for is barely making it.",2,-1.015756808
J Geyer,Had a three hour delay for a United flight leaving Newark so I purchased a Red Carpet one day access for $. From the moment I entered the red carpet lounge I found the entire staff unwelcoming never smile surly and down right unpleasant. I have never been in a lounge with an entire staff that was so unhappy. I was glad to get a cubicle seat to do some work but each encounter with the staff from check in to drink service to food service was very bad. I am surprised United would allow such an important lounge to be run so poorly. My only recommendation would be for a complete staff overall from the lounge manager to the bartenders.,2,-1.015756808
Peter Hauschnik,I was horrified by the service the food availability and environment of the lounge itself. In case all United Clubs are like this they do not deserve the tag lounge. Call them United airport area. It seemed to me better to wait outside of the lounge than inside. Take example from Etihad and Emirates or Star Alliance partner lounges as Air Canada Turkish Airways or Lufthansa. I wonder why Star Alliance does not have a global lounge standard.,1,-1.798894906
John Donnelly,Bought a first class ticket from SFO to Houston but they deny me access to any lounge as they say its for international passengers only.,1,-1.798894906
W Gobert,"Worst lounge I've ever experienced. Service non existent and offered nothing but cheap snacks. Furthermore most supplies were always empty or ""gunna"" be replenished. Also discover that despite a first class ticket I was not allowed access unless I paid $ US! To make it really bad. I decided that I needed a shower after a trip from Sydney - after I paid told that there was no shower - can you believe it.",2,-1.015756808
G Ng,Awful lounge. No food no shower and over crowded - probably due to a large number of Star Alliance flyers and lack of any other Star Alliance lounge. Every time I go to that SFO UA lounge for banana and yogurts only - never stay for over  min.,1,-1.798894906
J Carson,This may be a relatively new lounge but by international First Class standards it is poor. Staff on front desks do nothing more than check your boarding pass invite - no welcome no dialogue and United needs to get some serious training -  star service at best. Same stewed hot food laid out on hotplate during my visit (pm) - very unappetising and a bit like I remember UA onboard food to be. I see some other reviewers here raving about the new Business Class lounge - either that is truly different to the First Class lounge or some of them need to visit airline lounges around Asia to find out what good quality is all about. Penny-pinching clearly has a part to play but the sad thing is that I believe United set their targets at such a low level that most outside the USA are astounded how poor they are.,3,-0.232618709
J Ronkainen,Just snacks and basic beverages to offer. Some complimentary alcoholic drinks are available but must be ordered at the bar. There is Premium beverages - whatever it means - to purchase at the bar. Wifi works quite well.,2,-1.015756808
M Smyth,United's Star Alliance Gold lounges in the US are disappointing compared to their new one at LHR T. No hot food or proper cold food except bar snacks in plastic disposable cups. Not all beverages are complementary and grumpy staff expect tips for serving free beer! Perhaps United should stop offering paid access to these lounges (through credit card memberships etc.) and just raise their standards.,3,-0.232618709
J Balta,Personnel is present to check eligibility clearly not motivated to be of help. The advantage of being in this lounge basically consist of waiting in a confortable leather imitation sofa. If you want a shorter wait stay outside. WIFI connection seems faster outside. (must be my computer but it works outside). No luggage lockers available (because of safety? but I have been checked twice). No showers available. Only snacks available no useful food. Beer has to be paid unless it is one of two watery bud-light type. Lounge was very busy. Almost more confortable outside. How do you attract people to come into the lounge? Observing what the competition does would be useful.,2,-1.015756808
S Koenig,Lounge was fine. Took a shower watched TV in a large room used our PC and had some basic snacks for free. One can get food booze etc. in the bar area (basic wine and beer free others have to be paid for). Lounge was crowded so finding seats wasn't easy.,3,-0.232618709
S Pereira,Awful overcrowded it was impossible to find a seat. The restrooms were filthy I could not use them. I had to call the shower attendant and ask him to have the restrooms cleaned.,2,-1.015756808
Maria Henry,So small we couldn't find a seat food was practically non-existent - just some cookies and cheese and crackers. We just walked all the way around the lounge grabbed some crackers and headed out - probably the worst lounge I've been in.,1,-1.798894906
Daniela Massa,This is United Flagship Lounge in Terminal  at LHR Heathrow Airport. It's very spacious and modern white marble leather seating (open or more secluded).I was there for a late pm flight back to New York and there was so much food choice. What a shame that United didn't initiate this in the USA.,5,1.333657488
A Weber,Absolutely sub-standard. No food no accessible refreshments like water soda or juice. WiFi not working and staff is clueless. They even try to charge you for a glass of wine or beer.,2,-1.015756808
Antony Rana,Terrible management. I asked for shower and was told that in addition to shower I was entitled to  min of spa treatment with Business Class ticket. I was not looking for spa and just went for shower. They have  rooms and one had a wet towel and no soap. The do not provide shampoo. Finally I found a room with a folder towel. I hope it was clean!! I will not shower there in future. I think considering a country like India where anything can happen I should have ask for a clean towel and shampoo at the beginning (which is the norm in a shower facility). The two ladies manning the facility did not speak much English. After shower I went to the dining section. Menu selection was good - but the tables were dirty. For shower I gave one * - could not find a way to put zero.,2,-1.015756808
Klaus Holstein,Stop-Over-Experience on the way from Hawaii to Frankfurt. We had a stop for nearly hrs originally planned to be spent in downtown SFO. But we arrived sick with a flu so we needed to have a retreat at the business-Lounge. SFO Airport got a complete update even so the business-club-Lounge of United. But the furnishing is pretty pour new but cold and minimized to uncomfortable chairs and small tables. The breakfast buffet doesn't deserve this name pretty small and not rich. No deck chairs have been provided no showers or relaxing-room. Lots of guests tried to sleep on uncomfortable lounge chairs somebody need to think about the real needs of their guests. The best thing of this Lounge was the view. Only to recommend for a short stop not more.,2,-1.015756808
James Wallace,Of all the United Airlines lounges that I have been to this lounge has to be the best. In this lounge you don't need a bartender to get a beer pour a glass of wine or make a drink,,
J Monte,Not the worst UA lounge but on a par with most things United â€” pretty dreadful. No showers before the long haul to and across Asia? Unheard of! No food to speak of. Clean enough but very crowded.,2,-1.015756808
Alan Luck,"This is a low even for United. Buried in the basement of the International Terminal the United Club in Melbourne is embarrassing on a whole new level. From the sad offerings of ""hot"" food to the rarely- looked-after beverage station this lounge disappoints. The walls a soft padded dingy grey relic from the early 's only serve to bring the mood of the lounge down to a level of murky depression. The worst part of this lounge however is the pathetic ""WiFi service"" that is only provided by Melbourne Airport. Free WiFi from the airport is never good and in the bowels of Tullamarine's transport hub it degrades to ""nearly unusable."" All of this would be fine if not for the lack of chairs. For an international lounge that serves many major continents there are between  and  seats in the entire lounge. Most of the seats face another so it is more uncomfortable to take an empty seat thereby reducing the most often usable seats by half. Dishes running out food running out and messes left unattended are par for the course at the United Club in MEL. This is by far the worst United Club I have ever been to and Ive been to ORD C LAX T Newark and some of the other dregs of the Lounge world. United has an extensive history of disappointing its frequent travellers but after staying here I am looking into moving my miles to Air New Zealand or Singapore or another Start Alliance partner as a preferred carrier.",2,-1.015756808
James Dickson,Dreadful poor service overcrowded no food apart from stale bagels. Avoid this airline if you want to travel in comfort.,1,-1.798894906
J Lipschutz,The Club looks spacious but served very very simple Continental breakfast at a small corner. If you don't eat bagels or instant oatmeal there will be nothing for you to eat. No snacks for the breakfast. I was looking for helps. A waitress sat by the bar without uniform looked at me as if she was one of the customers. I didn't know that she was a working staff until she started to take trashes away from tables. Apparently she was not professionally trained. The receptionist did offer great helps proactively to arrange disability assistance.,2,-1.015756808
S King,This place is a joke. Water coffee and tea? beer isn't free? no food selection? what is the point of this place anyway? If you are paying money to go into united club at LAX don't waste your mind. Save $ and buy a steak at one of the steakhouse place in the airport.,1,-1.798894906
S Paice,Compared to their dismal offerings in Chicago this is different for United. On my visit it was busy but not overcrowded the food was good and the bar service excellent. The full breakfast buffet and lunch selections were hot and good quality I was impressed! Some more comfy/lounge-style seats would be the only real improvement I could suggest.,4,0.550519389
S Symon,Had a short one hour layover in Charlotte and decided to try out the Admirals Club. Luckily as a BA Silver member I have free access to US domestic lounges regardless of my itinerary. Lounge was a reasonable size with plenty of chairs. The selection of beverages and food however was pretty pathetic. Just yoghurt bagels and coffee - nothing else. I certainly wouldn't bother paying for the privilege to use it but it served its purpose for my short layover since I had time to grab a coffee and a couple of bagels.,3,-0.232618709
John Weber,If you ever consider to pay for club membership this should keep you from doing it. Old and worn out seats some as shabby as their airliners' seats. Unfriendly staff that tries to avoid work at all cost: my flight was delayed and I asked them to let me know when boarding would begin. Answer: We can't do that you have to go to the gate to find out. Food: in the mornings bagels muffins yogurt like a typical middle class hotel buffet. Decent bar with a lackluster bartender (see above about avoiding work). Pretty small place so it can get crowded. WiFi is the free wifi available all over the airport. And remember even if you fly first class as I do you have to be a club member or pay $ / for a day pass unless you fly intercontinental. This money is much better spent in one of the airport restaurants.,3,-0.232618709
Jens Honore,The US Airways lounge at Phoenix Airport unfortunately is no different from much of the companies other lounges. Old and worn out. The food selection is unhealthy and poor. The interior is worn old and cramped. Worst of all the staff seem to be as worn out and unattending as the decor and the food. They walk around looking very busy no smiles more like robots. Maybe the staff is told by the company to show no positive emotions so clients don't ask any questions. The only comment I got was how busy the previous day had been. It's pretentious and so not up to date.,2,-1.015756808
B Debnath,Travelled with family from New Delhi (DEL) to Des Moines (DSM) via Newark (EWR). In New Delhi they put us up in the Singapore Airlines lounge which is first class. At EWR their Business Class lounge is awful. Crowded no adequate number of seats. No food except crackers some fruits coffee and tea. Not even fruit juice or soft drinks. Surprisingly I had access to their very basic shower facility and they have free internet connectivity. The European airlines maintain better lounge facilities. However I was more surprised at DSM. DSM is a relatively large airport but United flies only a small plane ( seater) there from EWR once a day and they have no business class lounge facility at DSM! And they are not ashamed of it. I somehow felt that after the / incident in  the American airlines especially United got an opportunity to go no frills and they give an impression that they are all running on no profit basis. My experience with the United Club was simply disappointing.,1,-1.798894906
Sean Enami,United airlines has the most bare bones lounges in the industry. There is practically no food just crackers and soda. And this lounge was no exception. I am not sure why anyone wants to bother to get in these lounges. I guess some people like it just for feeling exclusive.,2,-1.015756808
G Schnell,The leather seats were very uncomfortable. Red wine was tasted by most and either left or they went back and paid for an upgrade. Food not so great. Bartender could not open the wine bottle. I had to do it for her. While that is not a big deal for me I did rank the staff low only because she had not been trained at all.,3,-0.232618709
M Robinson,This club is comfortable and flexible as you have the choice of sitting in the quiet area or the louder tv area. I like the two story window looking at the planes/weather etc. House wines and beer are no charge. Food options are limited. The soup is good but NEVER changes. The staff are courteous and as mentioned do a good job cleaning the whole complex. The Internet works well. It provides clean rest rooms and a place to get some work done.,4,0.550519389
A Simon,Although this lounge wasn't crowded for my early morning departure as Club members with USAir United and Air Canada international Business Class and international Star Gold economy passengers can access this lounge it does get crowds at times. This lounge is very comfortable as you have the choice of sitting in darker areas or in the light of the panoramic two story window looking at the Tarmac. There is also a large and separate quiet room for relaxing. Drink options are great as there are self serve options as well as a separate bar room. That being said food options aren't the best as there are just apples and chips most of the day. I do give this category  stars however as I have heard that in the evenings when the long haul departures are they offer more food that could be a full meal. The staff are very kind and courteous and do a good job cleaning the whole complex. The Internet works very well also. Overall I definitely would not purchase a $ day pass to experience this lounge or even buy it for $ when I booked my flight but if I fit into the criteria I described above it is better than waiting at the gate.,4,0.550519389
M Purbeck,Used this lounge when flying ANA to Tokyo. Had expected some good things from what is a new lounge and supposedly the flagship level of United Airlines but disappointed. No showers in First class section and you have to queue up to use Business class area if you want this amenity. Food choices at pm very limited to just  sad looking dishes under a heated light and a small choice of cheeses and cold items. Waiting staff are polite and quite attentive in contrast to quite miserable front desk reception staff. Seating choices all somewhat bland and one gets the feeling that there was little in the way of creative design used for this lounge. truly disappointing for a  First Class facility.,3,-0.232618709
S Thio,I was very disappointed to discover that Singapore Airlines Lounge at the new Terminal  was not open. We were directed to use the United Airlines Lounge. Unfortunately due to the busy flight schedules of various airlines who were using the United Airlines Lounge it was very crowded and difficult to get a seat not with the internet facilities. There was not a lot of food available and we were disappointed with the quality of the food.,3,-0.232618709
S Crowe,Surprised to read the recent reviews of the O'Hare lounge(s). Visited  on my last trip through (on a First Class tix) and was not impressed. This is their hub location expected top notch and it was disappointing. Cheese & crackers & fruit and drinks (free back then) from surly bartenders who made it quite clear they expected tips. Yah right. Fortunately I had not yet confirmed another st booking via ORD (on points as part of Star Alliance) and will not do so now. I'll do anything to route through Star airlines to enjoy the benefits of Air Canada or Lufthansa lounges. Makes United look like a donut shop.,2,-1.015756808
S Koenig,Large lounge. Often crowded in the main area but the quiet room was nearly empty. Very limited selection of snacks but we did get vouchers for a free premium drink at the bar (generic drinks were free). Unlike some United Clubs and Delta Sky Clubs no showers at US Airways clubs. Would have been nice after an overnight flight. Decent Wi-Fi.,4,0.550519389
S Koenig,Small club with no windows but it was clean and relaxing. Decent but small selection of snacks. We were flying first class to connect to an international business class flight out of Charlotte and while the US Airways agent at the check-in desk said we probably wouldn't be allowed in the club there was no problem (because of the same-day connection to international business class).,4,0.550519389
Erez Hartal,A private lounge located near the synagogue in the routanda. Smaller than the two lounges of Dan in concourses B and C but United Airlines and British Airways are allowed to enter. Supposed to be more exquisite. Lounge not crowded in the evening in busy August. Where Dan Lounge itself seemed to be packed as it is just before - flights depart to the US. Basic soft drinks juices and wine selection. Almost no refreshments. A disgrace. After visiting IST lounge of Turkish Airlines this pales in comparison.,2,-1.015756808
Erez Hartal,A disgrace a dingy lounge with not a lot of light located on top of concurse B in Ohare. Very basic breakfast offerings. If you want soft drinks service at the bar slow and requires a wait. Continental breakfast offerings. Delta club is much better. Got access due to business class ticket international otherwise would not pay the $ membership.,2,-1.015756808
Bill Atkins,There is no longer a dedicated lounge for Envoy Class - it is just the regular Club with one free drink ticket for which I got an undrinkable bloody mary. Only chips and salsa and some cookies as the food offering. Anything more substantial has to be paid for. Hardly Business Class standard especially when compared with the excellent BA lounge in this airport.,3,-0.232618709
Simon Peterson,Terrible. No room to sit. People allowed to use up sofa space with bags and no challenge from staff. Wifi too slow to be usable.,2,-1.015756808
J Williams,The club is very pleasant and what makes it worthwhile is a large quiet room with a sign stating no cell phones or loud conversations. It was actually quiet. A man was talking loudly on his phone and a staff member very professionally but very firmly asked him to go to the main lounge area as he was disturbing people in the quiet room. This room is a welcome relief from cell phones loud conversations etc. that can be jarring especially after a long international flight.,3,-0.232618709
N Green,The worst lounge and service  they might as well not bother offering the lounge. Food is stale old sandwiches  crackers and cheese. Flight delayed from pm till .pm  no hot food offered told to go to restaurant next door. Staff unconcerned and no concept of first class service. Avoid United Global First.,1,-1.798894906
M Dean,"Comfortable lounge with an excellent selection of hot and cold dishes and a very well-appointed clean shower room. A bit hard to find at the center of the C concourse behind a row of lockers next to the customer service desk. In addition to the plates of meat cheese smoked salmon and shrimp there is a menu to order a variety of hot dishes including ""surf and turf"". Very attentive staff assured that items were replenished and cleared away efficiently.",4,0.550519389
J Monte,Unbelievably bad even for the consistently bad quality of United lounges. LAX is probably United Airlines busiest international hub and yet the lounge has no showers! People flying from Asia and continuing to South America (as I was) will be shocked and infuriated at the lack of a single shower stall. I avoid anything associated with United Airlines but sometimes I have no choice.,2,-1.015756808
Dave Pearson,Travelling First Class Boston to Philadelphia on entering lounge advised that US Airways did not have a first class lounge in Boston and that this lounge was a pay lounge was advised that the lounge did not serve alcohol. The lounge had tea coffee and water if you required a soft drink you had to find someone to get it for you snack selection very limited and poor. In short do not pay to use this lounge.,3,-0.232618709
G Chapman,Friendly staff at reception desk. Pleasant relaxing atmosphere though unable to see out of windows because of louvres. Very poor selection of magazines - not even their own inflight magazine. Simple snacks but plenty of snacks and beverages.,4,0.550519389
J Kingston,This miserable excuse for a business class lounge gets worse every time I use it. The food is terrible. The furniture old and battered. The staff sullen and lazy. Then to top it off the lounge is filthy and the bathrooms worse. The only virtue is that the wifi is merely mediocre. There is a view of the runway. Good thing because gazing anywhere else gives one the creepy crawlies. We are forced into this awful lounge prior to boarding international star alliance flights (other carriers than United thank god). But if this lounge is any indication of what it is like on board their planes avoid at all costs (and I do).,2,-1.015756808
K Shimmin,"Plenty of seating with quiet corners. Food above average and plentiful drinks. Friendly staff. There was a hot baked potato dispenser with all the trimmings for a ""jacket potato"" and some delicious soup as well as sandwiches sausages fruits cookies and more.",4,0.550519389
S Koenig,"Pleasantly furnished though selection of free snacks is small. On an evening arrival we were given two vouchers for free ""premium"" drinks from the bar. When I went back for a second drink ready to pay for a bottled beer I found that draft beer was free (okay it was just Bud and Bud Light). Our US Airways flight's departure time was moved back from pm to pm but before it was  pm there were announcements that the club was closing right at . One staff member went around shutting off the TVs when that time approached. We waited the rest of the time by the departure gate. WiFi access decent. Wish they had PCs to use.",3,-0.232618709
Bill Atkins,A rather sad facility. Run down seating staff variably friendly or totally disinterested and more concerned with their personal affairs. Drinks and snacks a minimal offering. Frankly I often just sit in the terminal instead. Wouldn't waste my money for this.,3,-0.232618709
S Koenig,We arrived on international Envoy (Business) Class so had access to the lounge. It was roomy and nearly-empty quiet room was nice. Small selection of snacks coffee juice etc. No showers.

R Gibson,"We were booked into a United BusinessFirst cabin so we were given access to the Alitalia lounge located in the lower level (read as basement) of the terminal. The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (: a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad. United should be ashamed that this is what they offer their ""premium"" passengers.",2,-1.015756808
Andrea Simon,"This lounge provided a good quality of food as well as beverage. The internet connection is fine. Although there are no shower, there is a the washroom. The staff is friendly.

Bill Atkins,The membership is not particularly cheap and it offers less all the time. Selection of free coffees has been cut back and on this occasion the $ salad was inedible (old) so was exchanged for a barely edible sandwich.

C Lin,United Club in Narita is huge and when it gets crowded the wi-fi is overloaded and stops working. There is hardly any food and certainly no hot food nor food of quality.

Vietnam Airlines is getting slack and this is an unacceptable example of it here.,1,-1.798894906
Julie Ardagh,This lounge is in the new part of the airport (not the main Business Class lounge in the older part of the terminal). We were the only people in there apart from staff and it would have to be the worst lounge we have ever experienced. The food looked as if it had been there for hours and was all dried up and only luke warm. The staff were only interested in helping themselves to food and drink and as soon as they got back into their office they microwaved all the food they took because it wasn't warm enough. They weren't the least bit interested in us and we couldn't believe the poor attitude they had.,2,-1.015756808
J Segal,Large lounge and convenient. Chips and snack mix left out that is pretty much it. Bar area has drinks for sale good selection of flavored coffees available for free. Lounge is impressive when entering then you notice that almost all seating is tattered and in need of repair. Staff is nice- though other lounge on Concourse B is more intimate with great staff. Noticed that lounge also has wrapped cheese crackers and other items. Someone continuously circled cleaning the space as well.,3,-0.232618709
Oliver Wiesehahn,This was the worst and most low-budget lounge that I've ever been to as a business class passenger! Upon arrival at the front desk you are asked if you would like to use the cocktail-bar. The lounge is huge. Plenty of seats and these are quite comfortable (the only good point about this lounge). you get free coffee tea tab water with loads of ice from a pitcher and free apples as well as some this unidentifiable mixture of small crackers pretzels etc. Yuk! Soft drinks or juices: Forget it! That's what you need your cocktail-bar voucher for. You have the choice of  (yes: one) free alcoholic drink soft drink or juice. If you want more grab your wallet and pay big time: A beer will cost you  bucks! A very limited choice of magazines (no newspapers!). If you have time in Charlotte International don't go to the US Airways Club and rather have a seat in one of the rocking chairs or have a snack in the excellent food court. It is better and cheaper!,1,-1.798894906

All  lounges offer the same amenities - coffee tea soft drinks free of charge alcoholic beverages are for purchase only. There is a time appropriate range of snacks - pastries and fruit in the morning

A Gibson,The staff were very vague since this was the st time I had visited a United Lounge so I had to ask what facilities there were to use what was complementary etc... the check in hostess was not friendly or helpful at all. It was dirty every table had empty cups & rubbish on them. I would not make a special effort to find one again especially in the airport the regular vendors at the airport were better serviced than the Members Lounges.,2,-1.015756808
S Koenig,There are lounges in both Terminals  and . I went to the one in Terminal . Large comfortable airy. I was there in late morning. There were still some breakfast-type selections though very very few and mainly in the sweet treat variety. At least there were a few juices and a very wide array of coffee drinks from machines. Wi-Fi reception was good.,3,-0.232618709
U Jannsen,Quite crowded very small food selection (only crackers some cheese and carrots) you have to pay for alcoholic drinks (beer $). I was happy I only had to wait  min.,2,-1.015756808
S Barnetson,Business class lounge was clean reasonable selection of cold and hot. Average selection of spirits and wine. Good wifi no showers but clean toilets and massage chairs with good view of tarmac.,4,0.550519389
A Pedersen,The lounges are well equipped with soft drinks beer snacks hot dishes (but mainly very boring industrial food no tasty real food). Nice seating. I once spotted rats in the domestic lounge in Hanoi and heard from others that they are pretty frequent. Lounge in Hue have water all over the floors when rains are hefty. Internet free and works with fairly high speed. Nice smokersâ€™ rooms. No showers except in the international lounges and of very poor quality.,3,-0.232618709
R Vogt,Nice and quiet lounge with a good view to the apron. Excellent choice of food and beverages. Free Wifi is also available.,4,0.550519389
Michael Dean,United's best lounge by far. A ride up to a totally different class of service. The area was spacious comfortable and tasteful. A great selections of drinks was accompanied by a variety of Japan and Western snacks including sushi and small sandwiches. It does not compare to the hot meals and luxury of some Asian first class lounges but it shows what United can do when they made the effort.,5,1.333657488
P Brunel,I have been a member of the United Club for several years now. The only reason I will continue to be a member is the lower cost I can become a member through my husbands credit card. The lounge is basic and has now as of a few months ago started charging for their drinks. They still charge the same price for the annual fee yet no more free drinks. I am also continuing my annual membership since I do travel a lot and use the other star alliance clubs which are far superior to the United Lounges. They are definitely nothing special don't waste your money.,2,-1.015756808
R Fisher,It is a nice place to sit (compared to the rest of O'Hare) but there is nothing to recommend it. Lounge is boring and uninspired. Food is cheap no thought in the selection high in carbs and sugar low in taste. Like the rest of the lounge not designed to please anyone but will not offend either. United agents who can help with reservations and changes.,3,-0.232618709
Jens Honore,The United Lounge is old and worn out. The food selection is unhealthy and at best more like an unhealthy snack bar. The same goes for the bar. The wine is bad and the beer selection is main stream and boring. There's no sense for details. Last and most important the staff seem as worn out as the lounge. No smiles no pride. Just hanging in there. Like they know the company they work for is barely making it.,2,-1.015756808
M Gephart,The new United Club at Sea-Tac is fantastic! Great location refurbished look and feel and great staff. Great place to get out of the hustle and bustle of the airport. Standard UA Club fare but the refreshed feel of the place and the attentive staff makes it great. Good people watching from above too. If you're in SEA be sure to hit this one.,5,1.333657488
P Tress,Disgraceful. Food consisted of carrots and cheese and biscuits in plastic packs. Crowded you have to pay for drinks. If this is how United treat their customers they've lost my custom.,2,-1.015756808
R Slade,Nice little getaway from the hustle and bustle of ATL. Emphasis on the little but then again not too many UA operations ex ATL. Long and fairly narrow made it harder to hideaway somewhere although there are a few somewhat private cubicle work areas. Only one bathroom. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice views of tarmac. Minimal snacks - carrots crackers/cheese yogurt raisins. Not too noisy (the ubiquitous tv was up in a far corner) nice views. Downside: hard to hide away and take a nap.,2,-1.015756808
D Williams,I'm not sure why this is a lounge. Overcrowded drinks to be paid for at excessive prices and just a few snack items. Worse than sitting in the airport. Enough for me not to choose United Airlines again.,2,-1.015756808
N Miller,Compared to the waiting area downstairs this lounge is a bit of heaven - but that's not really saying much - lots of red and purple and funny chairs that are difficult to sit up in - food offering pretty sad (on a Sunday evening it was packaged cheese and crackers yogurt or warm tomato soup) - bar staff very helpful (and drinks are free) - decent view of the tarmac although it's around the corner from the international terminal so traffic isn't as interesting as it could be - no reading matter at all - most people have to pay for entry and unless you're desperate for a bit of quiet and/or a drink it's probably not worth it,4,0.550519389
J Warner,I have flown on United for several years now (in excess of M miles) and was a K for most of that time. This year I will not renew my lounge membership. Even post-merger the lounges are not well maintained people working the desk in larger airports are not consistently friendly or engaging and with the charging of alcohol that use to be included in membership (don't call it complimentary) it is just not worth it. A few weeks ago I flew Global-First to Sydney and was looking forward to the â€œFirst Classâ€ lounge. Reception personnel more interested in chatting amongst themselves and no one in the actual club area to help. The food in this SFO â€œexclusiveâ€ first class lounge had the opportunity to be exceptional but most of the serving dishes were empty. When travelling I almost always look for the alternative carriersâ€™ lounge for a better experience. Letters to United go unanswered.,2,-1.015756808
Rob Newman,I traveled on United frequently and am always passing through the United Club Lounge at Narita. What is nice is that it is large has showers and a nice view of the runway. But if you want to work there on the Internet be aware that the Internet speed is awful. It's so bad that if you are Gold you should just go to the ANA Club by gate  (which is where I am writing from now). And the food is actually better.,3,-0.232618709
G Santulli,"From the outside of the Jakarta Airport one would think otherwise when it comes to the First/Business Class Lounge but the one in Jakarta Airport is a surprise. Not very large but comfortable seats free Wi Fi with the ""code"" on a little slip of paper on the tables that could be mistaken for a scrap of paper! But this lounge has food like spaghetti the other night assorted fruits drinks and a nice espresso machine that does not require an engineering degree to operate. Simple atmosphere but a nice change and certainly nicer than the UA Lounge in Narita which is sad and really is a major disappointment with snacks and drinks. But for those who drink NRT must be like falling off their booze wagons.",5,1.333657488
G Santulli,"Tokyo Narita Lounge for Star Alliance Business Class is the pits. It is spacious and lots of nice chairs and is natural lit from its many windows but that is where the comfort level ends. While there are many nice chairs to sit in there are precious few power outlets and they are all US ""flat blade"" type of outlet not the rounded Euro plugs that are used in Asia too. Wi fi is the worst ever in a lounge I have seen. But the worst part of this lounge and I use the word sparingly is the awful food selection. Crackers shortbread cookies trail mix potato chips etc. Pretty poor selection. Now if I were a drinker which I am not I would be happy here. In the two hours I spent at the lounge at NRT the guy across from me had  glasses of red wine and at least  beers and countless trips to the grab the trail mix by the boatload. It is a shame the lounge is not food friendly because in comfort it has a lot of them beat.",4,0.550519389
S Koenig,Got in for a brief visit using two passes I got through my UA Explorer credit card. We were flying American and it was a longer than expected trip to the lounge. The lounge itself was fine and clean though smaller and overall more basic than I'd experienced with other United lounges. Basic snacks and hot beverages at self-service stations. It was early enough in the day that we didn't take advantage of the bar. Smallish rest rooms. Not a bad place to pass some time but not one of the better UA lounges I've seen.,2,-1.015756808
Keith Rogers,Not super great by any stretch but just fine for international departure on way to Istanbul. Food selection very limited but internet not bad.,3,-0.232618709
K Arentoft,To be honest - the United Club lounge in San Francisco International is one big joke! Very old and worn-out furnishing and the food (or what one should call it) is just as bad as it can get (crackers lousy cheese and carrots packed in plastic bags). But worst of all - obviously United do not trust their customers so if you want anything with alcohol - you have to go all the way to the other end to a bar - just to realize that if you want more than a flat beer - you have to pay for it! You are better of with a visit to Starbucks. And to all of those airlines (Lufthansa SAS etc) that uses the Club Lounge as part of the Star Alliance - hurry up establishing your own lounge - your customers are used to MUCH better service than what United can do.,2,-1.015756808
M Brown,I flew business class. I assumed that during my layover in Denver I can simply wait in business class lounge as I am used to. Surprisingly unless you are traveling internationally you have no access to the lounge. Not even with AMEX card. Finally I was able to go there for a fee of $ so I did. Carrots and packed terrible crackers. Nothing else. Really? Terrible. Whoever runs the lounge should look up any European lounge. International travelers in business class avoid Denver lounge. Also there is a large poster in front of the lounge access offering United Credit Card Lounge Access for $ a year.,2,-1.015756808
S Hayes,It was very comfortable a good selection of food and beverages. The lounge was tidy. Shower was good with good pressure. They could do with checking the aircon/ventilation as after the shower it felt like a sauna in there. Kind of defeated the purpose of having the shower in the first place. The staff on the counter and in the lounge were pleasant and efficient. Overall a good experience.,4,0.550519389
M Brown,The United Club locations in Houston are actually pre-merger Continental President's Club locations. The facility is nice with over sized leather chairs in addition to traditional bar seating. The facility is very clean and still looks rather new although it's probably close to  years old. The third level has a smaller seating area but can be a nice get away from the busy setting on the second floor. My main complain about the United Club is the lack of food options and the tiny glasses used for sodas. Crackers and cheese really aren't worth the $ yearly membership fee.,4,0.550519389
L McCloy,Very friendly and attentive staff. A variety of seating options. Quiet. Fantastic view of the tarmac. Rated the bar/beverages a  compared to lounges generally but for an airport of this size the bar offerings are excellent. Typical United snacky food: carrots and dip cheese and crackers apples snack mix etc. Really like this lounge.,3,-0.232618709
O Rosa,Nice view from that lounge toward the city. Not that much food (that's United) nice bar with even single malt scotch ($ for a single malt  year!). Pretty comfortable.,4,0.550519389
O Rosa,Pretty crowded due to a lot of delay and missed connections all around. Anyhow no problem to find a calm spot. Transfer staff in the lounge really helping everybody while keeping their cool and calm.,4,0.550519389
D Jackson,Miserable selection of snack foods. Many chairs are worn through. Automatic sinks in the washrooms don't function properly. WIFI is the slowest I've encountered at any airline anywhere in the world. I've passed through this lounge regularly over the past  years when flying Singapore Airlines or Thai Airways and its exactly as I encountered it the first time only older and more threadbare.,2,-1.015756808
James Baird,Previous reviews are accurate. Limited offerings but still had to wait in long line to get a glass of water and a cup of coffee. Crowded dirty unpleasant staff. Coffee was excellent though.,1,-1.798894906
P Tobias,Visited two lounges at O'Hare because of flight gate changes. One had a few free seats the other had no seats available. Food and drinks are a disgrace. Restrooms while clean are sub-standard.,2,-1.015756808
J Sabaduquia,Had a -hour layover in San Francisco and since I was connecting to a PS flight to JFK flying in Business Class I was granted free access to the United Club in Terminal . Reception was fast easy and the ladies were friendly enough. The entrance was grand and was welcoming. The lounge itself is of decent size the views of the runway are amazing and there were a decent amount of seating. Not the newest lounge but it was cozy enough. However as I've read before the food choices is a total disappointment. But I had bought my own food from the food court knowing this. There were some fruits crackers chips and some soda fountain and coffee machine. The soda tasted watered down but cappuccino was pretty decent. Free WiFi worked well and was fast had a nice seat with a powerport next to it by the window so overall a pleasant experience not the best lounge I've been but can't complain really.,4,0.550519389
R Mullins,Of all United Clubs I've visited this lounge is the probably the best. Very small and dated furniture but because it is tucked away in the International Terminal and services only one flight the crowds are small. Full breakfast served with juice quiche sandwiches wraps yogurt hot soup and full bar. All complimentary. If the domestic United Clubs took a tip from this small United lounge overseas the United Club would be much more on par with the service of other international carriers.,4,0.550519389
Danny Lew,The furniture is outdated and uncomfortable. The snacks are inadequate and club members are charged for alcohol. This lounge is absolutely horrible!,2,-1.015756808
D Ahearn,Tired in need of a paint job. We find a comfortable seat then head to the food - very limited nothing to qualify for a morning meal but automatic beer glass fillers. After searching we discover another corner with some more food but not much - limited cereal biscuits a soup no toast or sandwiches In the toilets and NO amenities - no toothbrushes no combs no shave no towelettes the room is dirty. The flight board shows only UA flights (about A size screen) - useless to others whose airline has paid for use of lounge!,2,-1.015756808
T Simmons,Very small and crowded lounge downstairs near gate D. Packed most of the time line at the bar was  deep and wi-fi was practically non-existent. A real dump compared to the United lounges at Newark or Houston. United should be ashamed of themselves.,1,-1.798894906
G Meyer,I used a one-time United Club pass issued as a credit card promotion to get in. I can't believe people would pay several hundred dollars a year for access. Food was nearly non-existent. The offerings were limited to a bowl of apples one flavor of yogurt cereal and a handful of shriveled miniature bagels that looked like they'd been recycled from the previous day. Juice was available only upon request at the bar (tips appreciated). Although the club provides wi-fi service it was not working when I was there. Only a few of the seating locations had access to electrical outlets. On the plus side the club was quiet probably because so few bother to use it.,3,-0.232618709
L Whitman,I have visited this lounge - times a year over the last + years. I can truly say that this is the dirtiest United Club I have ever visited. The carpet (a cheap item to change) looks like livestock have been housed in the place. The men's bathroom has been out of order for  of my last four visits,,
M Palmieri,Upon walking into the United Club Lounge at Chicago's O'Hare Terminal B (nearest B gate) this past Sunday it was the most reminiscent of a cold steely operating room at a major hospital rather than an airport lounge. Upon reaching the bottom of the escalator to the reception desk you could find a rather cold grey holding room with straight back chairs (none in leather) and utilitarian lighting. It looked like cheap IKEA furniture and fixtures filled the room. The most depressing lounge I have ever entered in the world and it just goes to show United never cared about it's elite customers and destroyed Continental's customer perks and more comfortable lounges. It was obvious to me every last penny was pinched at the frequent flier's expense. I left after a while to try the other lounge at B area and it was the same depressing room I experienced at the other end. Both expresso/cappuccino machines were broken and the bartenders had to be called from behind the wall to get a drink. Very depressing cheap bland lounges that felt like nothing more than gate-side seating in a large room behind a door. Shame on United.,1,-1.798894906
J Andrist,"I was in for a shock when I entered the United Lounge in LAX expecting to take a nice shower after a long flight from New Zealand. No showers! No food just a few snacks - carrots/ranch snack mix choc raisins bad cheese/crackers and a choice of two wines. I asked for a Sauvignon Blanc and was told that would cost ""extra"". The lounge was spacious and wifi worked ok. Magazines were promotional material but complimentary newspapers.",2,-1.015756808
B Temkin,Can't believe that this is a business class lounge! Peanuts carrots and some plastic covered cheese are all they serve. Some beer and wine are free but others cost. Pathetic!,2,-1.015756808
A Lewis,There are various signs posted all over the lounge about excusing their appearance while they upgrade the lounge however this is simply not good enough taking away from the tired interior the badly stained carpets and unpleasant damp smell this lounge is probably the worst I have ever visited every empty surface was littered with dirty dishes rubbish and discarded newspapers. A welcome change was the sight of some food sadly the sandwiches were stale. The internet while free was painfully slow the desk agent spoke only with eye contact. If you have the option take the short (mins) to terminal  and use either the Smiles or AA clubs.,2,-1.015756808
D Lublin,United Lounges are just sad. The Red Carpet Club is used for International Business. There is almost no food. The check-in staff was positively rude and unhelpful with long lines to get into the lounge. In the First Class Lounge the two staffers were typing typing typing. They were nice but not knowledgeable or helpful. First Class Lounge is like the business lounge but more empty and with slightly more food and drink available but certainly nothing impressive.,2,-1.015756808
A Lewis,Visited with my Priority Pass membership (not available to PP Select members) staff friendly enough visited the lounge in Terminal Very large up the escalator to the main level plenty of seating options including the bar work space areas TV theatre. Continued up to the next level much quieter however there is no bar on the upper level just self serve water and coffee. Soft drinks are only available (complimentary) via the bar service despite feeling slightly pressured to tip for my  cents worth of soda I did not. The food sorry snacks as is typical of United Clubs is poor - a selection of crackers with cheeses carrots fruit nuts etc. The best thing about this lounge for me was the availability of showers since I had a  hour layover here it was very welcome indeed. Wifi is free and no registration or codes were required.,4,0.550519389
D Mauro,I went into the lounge hoping to see post-merger improvements (from the Continental days) and was disappointed to see no changes. They have the same rude unprofessional receptionists who immediately banned my friend from joining me as a guest in the lounge (with my first-class ticket) and asked for $. I understand this is their rule but it was not handled very well. The breakfast food was cheap and basic lounge was extremely crowded and noisy and it was difficult finding seats. I spent five minutes there and was happy to leave. I won't be returning to this lounge and I couldn't imagine paying for it. This facility isn't even in the same league as the lounges from other Star Alliance carriers.,2,-1.015756808
Steve Ludington,I paid $/year for this? Crackers cheese and cookies? Complimentary wine is let's say mediocre quality - everything else terrible.,2,-1.015756808
S Paice,Red carpet club at C concourse. What a waste of time the only food was some nuts yoghurt raisins and some carrots. Hardly filling! They've now introduced a range of complimentary alcoholic beverages but the service is pretty mediocre. Compared to other Star Alliance lounges this is awful.,2,-1.015756808
S Wilson,This was the President's Club of Continental. I obtained access because I have Star Alliance Gold status and was on an international flight. However it took  minutes to get access because the reception staff member said my card's magnetic strip didn't state it was gold (although the card expressly states Star Gold and has never been refused before). Good selection of magazines poor selection of food (it was around ) with a few cereals and bagels and a couple of juices. Nothing hot besides coffee and tea. Free wifi but it seemed like a bit of a zoo definitely not worth waiting  minutes for. People taking long flights would be best using this lounge for the free wifi and then buy some food elsewhere in the terminal. Bathroom seemed well worn with loose lock on bathroom cubicle and significant signs of wear and tear.,3,-0.232618709
T Harding,The new B concourse lounge quite nice though food and beverage far behind international lounges I have visited. Caters to Lufthansa pax who are a bit more savvy. (B) Main B lounge crowded with poor snacks. C Concourse lounge better- more open with runway views but Untied employees still with (unearned) attitude- appear to be doing you a favor for joining and granting them jobs! International lounges in other nations are superior. Forget the F concourse lounge. Crowded stinky with minimal to no customer service. And I'm a  K member!,2,-1.015756808
C Barrett,Rarely have I encountered anywhere so uninspiring as the United lounge at SFO Intl. Decor and furniture are tired the layout is strange poorly sign posted and the food and beverage options are awful. No free wi-fi. I prefer to wait in one of the (admittedly average) bars in the terminal. As a separate note the first class lounge whilst comparing favourably to the business class lounge isn't much to write home about either.,2,-1.015756808
C Norman,I dread every time I have to fly to Chicago because I know I will end up in this lounge on my return leg to the UK. This is simply the worst lounge I have been in - the staff are very rude and unhelpful unless you are buying premium drinks and likely to give them a tip. The girls on the front desk are rude and clearly badly trained the food offering is very poor. One would expect at least one or two hot meal offerings not packets of cheese slices and crackers. There are some complimentary drinks on offer but through the miserable bar staff who are visibly annoyed that you are not buying a premium drink. They are also served in small glasses and the quality of the wine is appalling. The physical environment in the lounge is not too bad so these seems simple problems to rectify.,2,-1.015756808
J Kingston,This lounge is an embarrassment. Seating areas are filthy. Food on offer is minimal and poor. And only one wifi card per person. So a traveler can only have one connected device at a time.,2,-1.015756808
A Morris,A bit disappointed. My lasting memory will be the red covered pool table rather than the food or ambience? Shame it's a nice spot but let down by the limited choice of menu. The staff were friendly but working with limited resources in terms of food. Time to innovate?,3,-0.232618709
M Beattie,What a shocker! This is the first business lounge I've ever been in where it is more luxurious to stay out in the rest of the airport. Tatty stained furniture threadbare carpets crumbs and rubbish on the floor and half drunk half eaten food left on the tables. Food that would be embarrassing to see served in a cheap motorway services.,2,-1.015756808
H Balaraman,The lounge is clean and the wifi access worked well but the food offering is pathetic and consists entirely of unhealthy snacks. They should take a note of standards in other airline lounges and have at least two hot food items. Even Air Canada lounges have a hot soup.,3,-0.232618709
David Thomas,For a brand new lounge the internet was a disaster everyone was getting frustrated. I came to the lounge  hours before my flight to work what a waste of my time.,3,-0.232618709
M Fitzpatrick,What a disgrace our first and definitely our last. Not quiet shortage of food shortage of drink empty soap dispensers in toilet generally not clean and dreadful WiFi. I guess I shouldn't be surprised the whole airport experience from moment of landing to leaving was horrid. When people pay thousands to travel first class we expect far better. We certainly expect better of Virgin Atlantic with whom we were traveling.,2,-1.015756808
D Rolton,This lounge needs redesigning with a wrecking ball. A place of peaceful relaxation - certainly not. Liquor - yes get drunk to avoid the disappointment. Service - what would that be? Food dodgy looking soup plus a few skinny sandwiches and biscuits. Wine - that'll be red or white then. Milk for tea. Oh ok- they found some - peculiar these Brits and they like it to be hot. Sitting in it right now resisting urge to send out for a pizza.,2,-1.015756808
D Rosen,Visited this lounge twice during this trip while connecting on the outbound and inbound trips. Both times the lounge was dirty the bathrooms filthy food not worth eating and the general atmosphere so unpleasant that it was better to wait by the gate.,1,-1.798894906
D Hund,ALL the lounges at Ohare leave a lot to be desired. Free drinks - but who can drink them? The entire bar smells so badly of disinfectant - and the glasses too - that I can barely drink there. I finally have gotten wise and ask for my drinks in the plastic cups. At least these don't smell like chemicals. So crowded and the food is terrible.,2,-1.015756808
G Heiser,In comparison to other RCC lounges this is quite reasonable. They have sandwiches salad and some cheese. Seating is a bit old. Lounge staff kind to me and my family. There is free but slow wifi. The selection of spirits is quite nice. It gets really crowded due to many Int'l departures from -pm.,3,-0.232618709

Frances Jojart,We had four hours in this lounge while waiting for our Qatar airways flight. The service was exemplary and made us feel right at home. The showers were clean and great before the flight home. Well done to the ladies who served us.,5,1.333657488
Kevin Tunnicliffe,Excellent lounge with very attentive staff. Lots of seating options and a good size dining area. Showers excellent. We found seats by the window with good views of the apron and runway. Food was great we had several items off the tapas menu to share. The deep fried squid and the cheese on toast were exceptionally good.,5,1.333657488
J Michael,"Simply put United is shoving its international business class customers in its ""bus terminal"" Red Carpet Club. It used to be a membership Club but is now available to persons buying day passes signing up for credit cards paying with points US Airways in fact virtually anyone with a pulse and money can now enter which means it's overcrowded. Showers didn't work the attendant said United doesn't maintain them. The lounge attendants are rude and unhelpful. Cheap drinks are on the house but not an open bar. Anything of quality must be paid for. A pretzel is United's definition of food. Absolutely abysmal.",2,-1.015756808
C Norman,This lounge is the worst I have ever been in. Considering I paid nearly $ for my ticket the complimentary food on offer was limited and poor quality. The worst part of the experience was the bar staff who were very rude. I was here a year ago and I put it down to individual staff unfortunately the same miserable lady and gentlemen were still working there! They have serious attitude and seem to take a view that complimentary drinks are for cheapskates. Even though I regularly travel business next time I'm in O'Hare I will simply go to a paying bar where I can get service with a smile!,2,-1.015756808
L Hooper,This has to be the worst lounge I have ever had the misfortune to wait in. The charge was reasonable to enter but the lounge was hidden by stairwell so one can not see the disgrace one is paying for until it is too late. The drinks consist of cold coffee and a cappucino machine that has seen better decades. There is no hot food but some stale Bagels that if brave could be toasted in a machine that had not been cleaned out of crumbs since it was opened. Having said this I should not have been surprised after a  hour flight into SFO with United where they did one drinks run and two food runs. Most of the staff hid in the back until landing. The only break in boredom was the epsiode of asking for a G&T and being asked to pay for it having upgraded to premium economy.,2,-1.015756808
A Scott,Just arrived home from LAX. Totally shocked at the way we have been treated as upper class passengers! We were made to walk from terminal  to terminal  so we could use a lounge. The Virgin Loft Lounge only caters for Shorthaul passengers - lacking any decent food (a cookie and a grape at best with cheese cut to the size for a mousetrap!) No showers small toilet and wash facilities. We have always used Air NZ lounge previously which was excellent. Virgin must rectify this situation quickly otherwise Upper Class passengers will seek alternatives. The shuttle bus ride back to term  was such an experience - we have now seen areas of the airport no one would want to see - trash bins cleaning vehicles etc (all part of the luxury upper class experience no doubt!),1,-1.798894906
Ian Carpenter,Was offered the lounge as an alternative to the Air New Zealand lounge as an Upper Class Virgin Atlantic passenger. The lounge is poor in comparison to other lounges that I have experienced Bar is okay if a little limited but food is very poor - bread cheese soup and cookies No showers or changing facilities. No comparison with the Air New Zealand lounge at LAX or Virgin Lounge at Heathrow. Very disappointing!,3,-0.232618709
E Apps,"Much too small for the number of people there - reception desk staff abrupt and uninterested until they made an announcement ""whoever left their drink at the reception desk please come and get it back"" - really?

David Dale,Purchase of One Time Pass from United Airlines website. The lounge in Hong Kong is quite spacious and did not feel cramped when flights arrived and premium passengers used the lounge. Food options were plentiful and there was no shortage of drinks. The lounge has a deck over looking the terminal and views out over the tarmac. The United staff at the lounge were courteous and helpful. For the price of the pass it was well worth it.,4,0.550519389
G Chapman,There are two huge lounges both divided in two - like sitting in an aircraft hanger. Cluster of seats but no sound barriers - conversations and cell phone conversations can be heard everywhere. Very limited selection of snacks as they sell meals bookable at the service desk. Might as well have stayed in the departure lounge downstairs at the gate!,2,-1.015756808
Steve Crocker,Although we were transiting to Manchester we had over three hours at LHR and so decided to use the Arrivals Lounge. It was an excellent choice. The friendly staff on reception offered us showers immediately and after these we sat in the lounge and enjoyed an excellent tasty well cooked breakfast served by more friendly staff. The lounge was comfortable and clean with excellent shower rooms. The WiFi was slow at first but then speeded up to an acceptable level. It was a pleasure to be in this lounge after the grim lounge we had experienced on departure from Miami. The lounge was not crowded while we were there although given its size it could be if a lot of flights arrived together.,5,1.333657488
Steve Crocker,As grim a lounge as I can recall for many years. A couple of apparently arguing staff on duty. The lounge was totally enclosed with no view of the outside and the seating was in my view not up to the standard you expect in a business class lounge. The food was nothing special pretzels cookies and when a few sandwiches appeared they were soon grabbed by the nearest passengers although they were edible. WiFi seemed to be an acceptable speed for what I needed. Toilets were adequate and clean (just about) although they had a strange smell. With only one flight a day I accept that Virgin's choice is limited but they really need to have words with Club America as this lounge does Virgin's reputation no good.,3,-0.232618709
K Mccue,Like earlier reviewers I found this lounge to be pretty disappointing. To the point that I was questioning if I was actually in the lounge or rather some 'general boarding but status' room. Limited drinks are free (points) but the food is really nonexistent. Packaged crackers and cheese carrot sticks and that's really it. Lots of space outlets available and free wi-fi (ask for card at the desk) this lounge leaves me wishing for more elitism feel (I did pay considerable dollars for my int'l biz seat- can't you up things wi some cut fruit more variety in snacks).,2,-1.015756808
Herst Berger,"Awful place. Not recommended. Dirty. Complimentary wifi requires red club membership. Very basic snacks. Not even close to the very basic business class standards. Try to avoid. Too pitiful Lufthansa partners with the guys to offer their ""business"" lounge to its passengers.",1,-1.798894906
J Kingston,This lounge is physical adequate and has a nice view of the runway and ramp. Free wifi offered. That's it for the positives. Negatives - simply the worst selection of food that I have ever seen for a premium class lounge. Carrots packaged in plastic of the genre one throws into a childs lunch box slices of monterey jack cheese also packaged in plastic. And a pitiful assortment of packaged cookies. This is so far below standard that it is insulting. Unfortunately this is the only lounge that Swiss business passengers can use at SFO.,3,-0.232618709
K James,Worst lounge I have ever been in. Empty of staff empty of any food except pretzels and wifi so slow that when I tested the speed it came back with basically the equivalent of k dialup modem. Fine for the s but just appalling. I know it's not Virgin's own lounge and with  flight a day they are not going to do anything about it but Club America ought to be ashamed.,2,-1.015756808
Sang Fung,I was lucky enough to get access to this haven of peace and good vibe. The lounge is upbeat but relaxing music cool staff and gourmet food and champagne. All you need do is find a nice seat (plenty on offer) and a decent magazine and wave your hand and one of the cheerful young waiters/waitresses take your order. I enjoyed Lanson champagne with excellent choices of food.,5,1.333657488
Stephen Lloyd,"Virgin Little Red lounges at Heathrow Terminal  and Edinburgh Airports are basically space in the Servisair Lounge. When the route LHR-Edinburgh started I could get into both lounges using my Singapore Airlines Gold Card as per normal Virgin lounges. At Terminal  in Heathrow it is a good - minute walk about as far apart as you can get in the terminal from lounge to gate. Three time I have been refused access here - you have to go back down the stairs go to the internal desk hope it is manned or the person is free get a pass from them and go back. it is more hassle than it is worth. In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there. Basically it's Virgin Gold or nothing - it would have been nice to communicate it. Whilst the in air product competes with BA on the routes on the ground they are poles apart. Sad to get driven back to using BA because of this.",2,-1.015756808
Chris Ford,It is relatively small but I was lucky enough to be one of only a handful of users. There is the same offering of food and drink there (bar service even for soft drinks horrendous cubes of cheese pretzels and that trail mix stuff) as every other RCC. There were no flight announcements which would have been nice. Unlike most airport lounges this one is completely enclosed as in no windows! It is located right next to the airport shuttle train underground.,3,-0.232618709
M Chan,What a dump! Aside from the staff at the front everything else was kind of terrible. The food was minimal no bar service and most furniture needed to be updated.,1,-1.798894906
Jeff Lee,This lounge was brutal. I had a First Class ticket to YYC which makes it an international flight and I expected decent service. I had to pay about $ for a Sam Adams beer there. There was only cheese and crackers for food in spite of being there over supper hour. I expected soup or something of that variety. Lastly there was not wifi available there. The seating was old and worn out the lounge had dirty dishes on many of the tables and lacked newspapers.,1,-1.798894906
Richard Vaux,No staff on duty. Only pretzels or Cookies to eat. When you walk in its business ticket passengers to the right and others including priority pass to the left in a separate lounge. Never have I felt so second class having a Priority pass card.,2,-1.015756808
Casper Yap,Very close to the gates  minutes or so to boarding. Service a bit slow did not manage to eat as it took + minutes to get the food served. Showers were very useful.,3,-0.232618709
Casper Yap,Nice place to hang out prior to flight. Enough sofas to lie down and take a nap. Meals okay lots of space to relax. Showers useful with steam function. Did not try the massage or beauty treatments.,5,1.333657488
B Weber,Denver Red Carpet - while large - has some areas that leave something to be desired. Limited plugs. They could do a much better job ensuring that each seating cluster has plug in or access to one. One of the benefits of airline clubs is the convenience of not having to fight for outlets and this particular airline club has the same issue - something that surprised me for United's hub. Other airline clubs are much better on this front. Clean up service of old plates/glasses. Service to clean up old plates and other glassware is sporadic at best. I had to clean up my area before sitting and the table I moved them to has not been cleaned up in the two hours I have been here.,3,-0.232618709
D Little,What a dump! No food agents all had an attitude. Bar service only with some free drinks but If you do not leave a tip they look at you and you never get service. Bathrooms not clean at all. Plugs did not work. No seats. Old run down very bad..,1,-1.798894906
J Schwartz,Very tired and disappointing lounge. Not a First Class environment more akin to worn out frequent flier lounge circa . Staff at desk demonstrates little interest or professionalism. The food offered is laughable. When compared to even the Air France Affaires or Virgin Upper Class Lounges at Dulles - both Business Class offerings - United's falls flat.,3,-0.232618709
Casper Yap,Nice to be able to wash up and have a shower on arrival in London Heathrow. Breakfast was tasty and efficient. Not crowded but space on the smaller side.,4,0.550519389
Janet Walford,"This is a shared lounge with Cathay Pacific and several others. It is also the type of lounge that appears to be accessed by anyone paying a nominal fee or having a paid-for lounge pass. As such it was absolutely crowded out - we got two of the last seats available on a Thursday afternoon. There was nothing to eat apart from soup (unnamed) and crisps and only quarter bottles of indifferent wine (the white ran out about an hour after we arrived) with a few general spirits such as G&T. This is not a proper business lounge of the type you would expect from Virgin and we were very very disappointed. There were no UK papers hardly any magazines and the room was small and cramped. We watched people come in walk around looking for a seat and then leave again. I asked the woman on the reception desk what happened when the lounge was full and she told me that she ""sent them away"". When I asked where to she replied ""out of here"". Chicago is not a small airport in the middle of nowhere it is an important international hub and as such business passengers should be provided with facilities to match the price paid.",2,-1.015756808
B Anderson,Had access due to codeshare with Air New Zealand. Actually a pleasant spot although limited selection of food and beverage but more than adequate. Nice quiet space and never seemed busy for early evening. Lacks comfortable seating but sounds much nicer than anything United seem to offer in their own country.,3,-0.232618709
G Paterson,This was the worst lounge experience I have ever had. My wife and I arrived for a .pm flight to Cancun at about am. The lounge was practically empty There were a few holiday makers. There were no help yourself drinks - you had to ask for an alcoholic beverage. The spectacular view of the runway was a row of industrial air vents on a roof. The cooked breakfast would not have fed a sparrow. I went to get my free spa treatment to be told that they could fit me in at pm. This was  am - a bit problematic considering that I would be half way across the Atlantic at the time. So my wife and I had no free spa treatment. There was one lady getting her nails done but the problem was that there were no staff around - probably did not want to pay them overtime on Easter Saturday. To cap it all I went to the loo and there was a disgusting smell of smoke as somebody had been in there smoking. Considering we were offered the exclusive privilege of being in there for the princely sum of Â£ each I just did not rate it at all. Very disappointing indeed - stay clear unless it's free!,2,-1.015756808
Peter Barry,We arrived at the airport very early had small snack from Gravlax counter/salad bar. Excellent choices and very tasty. Very pleasant service from waiters. Good changing facilities for baby. Main meal of curry with very decent Merlot. All very relaxed and nice to get out of way before night flight. My wife got hair treatment. Staff food and drink quality and the extras of beauty salon/ barbers all made the start of trip very easy.,5,1.333657488
Paul Thornton,Shoe polish free spa treatments or free haircut in the salon. Then off for a shower if you so wish then find a seat and the waiter will attend your beverage requirements. The food choices are amazing they have a full Deli counter or you can choose from the extensive food menu. After this you can play pool or retire in the library while the kids can play in the softplay. And the best bit is you can check in as many hours before as you like we have a connecting flight from the North so we always take a flight early in the morning so we can spend longer in the Virgin lounge.,5,1.333657488
J Aberg,This lounge leaves a great deal to be desired. I visited on New Years Eve when there was not much traffic in the lounge which is probably the only nice thing worth mentioning. The catering was appalling and range of drinks very limited since several machines were out of order. There were no newspapers and the very few magazines in the lounge were a few months old. I am sure this place was decent in the 's but it has not seen much upgrade ever since. Since I find United to be the worst US airline by far this lounge did nothing to change my point of view. On a final note if you are considering paying  USD to enter the lounge (ie. if you do not hold credentials to give you free access) I would seriously recommend you to stay way from this stale and tame lounge.,1,-1.798894906
Dan Willmott,Not as grand as LHR but present staff food and drinks are fine the only issue is sharing with other airlines can become very crowded. It is clean and comfortable.,4,0.550519389
N Sheppard,The perfect way to relax before your flight. Quality food and service delivered with a smile.,5,1.333657488
M Baker,Paid Â£ to book into the clubhouse - but ended up spending an hour on an over crowded bench eating junk food in the terminal as the clubhouse would not let us in (they had lost our booking). Basically it would have been cheaper and less stressful to rip up a Â£ note and throw it around every five minutes before the flight. Staff unhelpful and Virgin not interested in refunding or helping despite nearly two months of trying.,1,-1.798894906
Jim Dobernig,United Airlines Red Carpet Club first class/business lounge is in short 'lame'. Plenty of room but you are treated only to a diet of the type of nuts and bar snacks you'd find at the corner tavern. You are issued two drink tickets which are good for one drink (go figure) and that's it. Free Wi-Fi : big deal. That is it. Dirty dishes litter the tables with no staff cleaning anything.,2,-1.015756808
B Tarbox,Totally lame. After paying $ for international first class they offer cheese and crackers and you pay for drinks?,1,-1.798894906
D Mauro,After a trip to Asia and several visits to fabulous lounges there I was so disappointed with this clubroom. It's dated has no real food and looks like an employee break room. Definitely did not make me feel appreciated (as a frequent flier) by the airline.,2,-1.015756808
Steve Spiegel,I'm currently sitting in the lounge. Only  other passengers in here so I'm wondering if there is another Virgin lounge here as this one is abysmal. No food whatsoever. No atmosphere. Probably the worst lounge I've been in. The staff begrudgingly trundled off to get me some milk for my lukewarm tea. Just dreadful.,3,-0.232618709
Patricia Simon,They provide a Meet and greet service upon arrival  we were expedited through immigration and customs and taken out to our taxi. Upon departure we were meet at our taxi  checked in and assisted through Immigration security and to the lounge -there is a small fee. At the lounge there is a snack table and fully stocked bar there is also a smokers gallery. Air Conditioning cable TV wireless internet access and reading materials. Very welcoming and friendly efficient staff.,4,0.550519389
Derek Greenaway,Pretty basic normal Club America standard. This facility is used as a shared lounge by Virgin and British Airways. Quite comfortable and well laid out small business centre with a couple of terminals free wi-fi available. Soup and a few sandwiches available they seem to run out of these at regular intervals but rather than just getting more made appear to fill them once an hour. The problem is that if there is a sudden influx the sandwiches soon disappear but you may have to wait  minutes for them to bring in any more. Drinks not too bad spirits and beer ok a couple each of reds and whites more in fridges if you scratch around. Soft drinks are from large two litre bottles can be a bit flat - coffee and tea available with a dish of cookies. All on self service. If you are a bit hungry then you may do well to eat before security and then use the lounge for a relax and drink. The eating on air side is dreadful - Burger King Pizza and Panini is all that's available.,2,-1.015756808
S Wilson,Was challenged as to my eligibility to enter although I am Star Gold on an international routing then grudgingly let in but I wasn't missing much. Plenty of staff doing next to nothing can see no reason why there are  people in this lounge when it charges for any decent food and drink several staff just stand around doing nothing. The worst is the excuse for snacks which comprises a platter of cubed American style (ie rubber) cheese of three different colours under a lid with a selection of crackers. Wifi not free. Why does United bother? It may as well get rid of all staff bar an entry guard and cleaner and just let it be a quiet place to sit. The real disgrace is that you can't take bought food from elsewhere into this lounge presumably because you are meant to buy United airlines paninis.,2,-1.015756808
Joe Pollhein,"Not so crowded as the one on the E terminal and more spacious. Food terrible - crackers cheese horrible looking ""fresh vegetables."" None of the beers are gratis - everything has a price.",1,-1.798894906
Jonathan Granato,I paid the $. fee for the Virgin Clubhouse at SFO which is immaculate. The agent at the Clubhouse upon my telling her it was my first visit showed me the amenities and features. She made me feel welcome.,5,1.333657488
D Poole,An oasis of calm in HKIA. Attentive staff make sure that your drink is always full and that you have food - which is good - when you want it.,4,0.550519389
J Aaron,What a depressing place. After checking in we were informed the lounge would still close at scheduled time in spite of our flight to SYD being delayed more than an hour. Several announcements were made to push everyone out by :. Our flight wound up boarding about an hour later. The seats are old and run down. Lighting is bad. Food is cheap snacks served in disposable containers. It reminded me of a college dormitory cafeteria between meals but the dormitory would have better choices. We wound up eating snack mix and yogurt covered pretzels. We were given two coupons apiece for drinks. Seats are old and beaten up. The bathroom is clearly old and run down. I can't explain it but there is a sad feeling to the place. I think we would have had a better time just going to and staying at the gate.,1,-1.798894906
Robert Williams,"I was eager to try the newly renovated Clubhouse. About the second nicest lounge I have used and the most stylish. Seating comfortable cooked breakfast good plenty of room and the business centre provides laptops as well as wifi. There is a Cowshed spa - and here is my only criticism. The old lounge had perfectly good complementary spa treatments and offered free shaves and haircuts. Cowshed charges for most of its services and offers only massages facials and related therapies: great if you just want pampering but useless to a busy male flier like me who just wants to look his best at the other end of his flight. Also there is no ""revivals"" lounge at Gatwick - and Virgin do not have their own lounge in Orlando.",4,0.550519389
James Wyatt,Kenya Duty Free First Class Lounge. Virgin really need to do something about this lounge. It is a shared lounge but dreadful - words cannot adequately describe it. A dingy windowless room with worn out old leather sofas. Terrible selection of drinks and nibbles. A handful of several day old newspapers. Dial up internet pc was so slow I gave up.,2,-1.015756808
A Woodhouse,"An absolute disgrace we had to pay for a beer and a glass of wine and the ""food"" on offer was disgusting. Sweaty cubes of cheese and something unidentifiable in large glass tubes which looked like coloured marbles. Considering the extortionate price charged by United for business class seats they need to do much better than this. The lounge at San Francisco was only marginally better in that we were given  vouchers each for alcohol.",1,-1.798894906
Wendy Gordon,This is one of the saddest lounges I've used. I'm traveling on Air Canada and originally was turned away because they wouldn't recognize my Executive First ticket and told me I needed Star Alliance Gold membership. Then at the gate the Air Canada gate personnel overheard me saying I needed to find some wi-fi and he suggested I try the lounge. I told him I had been turned away he helpfully called down got into a discussion about the business class eligibility and sent me down. No cocktails - there's a bar but it's unstaffed and the only drinks are a few diet cokes and some bloody mary mix. A few apples and bags of chips complete the offering. Most unhelpfully since I'm not a Red Carpet Club member I had to buy my own wifi access on t-mobile. This contradicts the info on the little placard that says t-mobile wifi is available on a complimentary basis to international customers. Well last time I checked Toronto was in Canada not the US. The bathroom is dingy grey the tiles are dirty and I swear there's graffiti and scratching on the door to one of the stalls. The lounge seating area is nice enough but they need to make more of an effort to make this more than just a glorified waiting area. I certainly wouldn't pay $ a year to use these facilities.,2,-1.015756808
John Estrada,Lounge is vast and well appointed but you realize quickly that it's full of people and seating is at a premium. The shower facility is fine with a nice amenities/toiletries bag given out. Food consists of snacks like saltines cheese bananas a few sushi rolls and nuts. Not much more and the beverage selection is standard cafeteria. You would do better to use the ANA Business lounge that is located very close to United RCC if you're a Star Alliance Gold Member. There ANA has a nice selection of refreshments including a Sake Bar soups sandwiches and a kitchen where you can walk up and order various noodles. There is free WiFi.,3,-0.232618709
N Stilwell,Cowshed is great laze around in a jacuzzi shower have your suit pressed and shoes cleaned. Sit at the bar eat a meal at the restaurant. Deli counter for lighter bites. Great drinks great staff and viewing areas. Pool table and cinema sized screen with lazyboy chairs. A sanctuary at Heathrow airport loved it!,5,1.333657488
N Stilwell,Only one daily flight from JNB to LHR for Virgin so lounge is not huge. It is however very classy and has most things needed. There is a full menu or drinks and food several options which are all freshly prepared and very nice. Several shower rooms to freshen up. Business suite with three computers free internet etc. Comfortable private seating areas and a sit up bar. Table and chairs if you would rather eat at a table. Nice looking lounge and works well. Long way to gate for flight  mins I'd guess,4,0.550519389
Dang Pham,One of the worst Red Carpet Club I ever visit. Rude welcome personnel. I used this Club because the First Class Lounge is too far to the Air Canada gate. The personnel don't know that Star Alliance Business Class travellers can use Red Carpet Club and ask for Red Carpet Membership. It's a very big difference between the United Lounge in Hong Kong and the Business Lounge in Chicago ORD. And don't bother about the food and beverage - it's almost nothing.,1,-1.798894906
Dang Pham,Very courteous welcome. Breakfast choice is OK but choice of drinks is limited. No Internet only from the Airport Internet provider but the people who had paid an overprice fee said it doesn't work. Access to the Club by  very old elevators is very slow so don't wait too close to your departure because there is another long line security check at the gate.,2,-1.015756808
Wendy Cocker,Absolutely fantastic facility. We were delayed  hours at Gatwick on our way to Vegas. Staff in the V Room could not have been better - food and drink provided throughout the day and no queue for the toilets. Staff even kept the lounge open late to provide us with a haven away from all the fraught tempers downstairs. If you are able to access this lounge it is worth the cost - especially if you are delayed. We travelled with an  year old who didn't complain once and was kept entertained with facilities on offer.,4,0.550519389
Yvonne Watton,There is no food at all and you are forbidden to bring food that you may have purchased elsewhere into the lounge. The staff were not very helpful when I asked if there were any newspapers to read - I was advised that if I couldn't find one they must have all been taken. Its a shame that Virgin and British Airways have to use this facility - its only the second time I have used this lounge and wouldn't bother again we cleared our own table which did seem to prompt the staff to clean other tables that had been left.,2,-1.015756808
Kerry Wong,Fantastic. Got breakfast included drinks also. Could have had a glass of champagne but as not a drinker so missed out! Funky washrooms - unisex so be aware. Staff polite friendly.,5,1.333657488
Lynne Whitmore,First time user of LHR Clubhouse and very impressed. Shown the various areas by a staff member and looked around ourselves before deciding on a seat viewing the runway. Firstly deposited bag and given a ticket to collect it prior to boarding. There were many different types of seating areas: cafe style,,
Andrew Ward,This is a new lounge dedicated solely to Virgin Atlantic. Not too impressed on the first visit very little food on offer a few crackers two types of rather solid or stale bread cheese and a type of ham. This was before one of VA's sleeper flights we were warned at check in that a hot meal would not be served to us as we were located at the front on the upper class cabin how you are supposed to exist on this baffles me. The drinks are pretty poor as well only two white wines on offer tasted both - in my opinion undrinkable went for the 'champagne' a californian sparkling wine. did manage one glass but resisted going back for another. The staff pointed out that there was only one diet coke left they would not have any more until Monday (this was Thursday afternoon). In all the lounge was very crowded by the time the flight was called. If part of upper class fares are to cover the lounge then this is not good value. A general lack of toilets needed to queue to use.,2,-1.015756808
Andrew Ward,Smallish lounge although with only  Virgin flight a day this no surprise. Felt a littel crowded on this full flight in Upper Class. Nice design - deli feel with plentiful drinks selection and reading materials. Staff ranged from pleasant to fairly disinterested. Food selection a little limited - expected more hot choices but clam chowder was delicious. Flight delayed which not announced until fairly late.,4,0.550519389
John Charlesworth,This lounge makes a night flight work. Check-in early complete all outstanding work issues here rather than the office. Wander over to the bar and have a champagne while contemplating the menu at the restaurant. Enjoy a freshly cooked rather than reheated food and wine tasting as it should at a table as opposed to your seat. If you want a haircut or massage these too are available.,5,1.333657488
J Alsop,Very impressed with Virgin's Clubhouse at Heathrow. The lounge was quiet spacious and well laid out. Food was excellent. I took advantage of the Cowshed and booked a wet shave - great way to start a morning flight. Staff were very attentive. Overall experience was good - a very relaxing start to my trip.,5,1.333657488
K Willis,Early morning and an early start meant the lounge was very quiet. It was a pleasure to use. Food was excellent high quality and staff generally very attentive. Very pleasant and relaxing start to the journey. Highly recommended.,5,1.333657488
John Maguire,I found the staff very helpful at all times. The food and drink selection was very good with the option of having dinner before the flight. Bathroom & shower facilities were excellent and kept very clean. Its locality to the departure gate was excellent with only a  minute walk to endure. Overall very good.,4,0.550519389
